Note 8 - Balance Sheet Components
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, original device
manufacturers, or ODMs, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly
from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. Three direct customers accounted for 27%, 18% and
12% of our accounts receivable balance as of April 27, 2025. Two direct customers accounted for 17% and 16% of our accounts receivable balance as of
January 26, 2025.

Litigation
Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended
complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand
between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to
dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from
judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel
affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in
dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to
reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay
the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter.
NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of
certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued
judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the
case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January  26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of
results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
In June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Fiscal Year
Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The first quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week
quarters.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,
investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other
charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of
information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing the
effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the year ending January 25, 2026.
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,
including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within
each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.

Text Content:
Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
