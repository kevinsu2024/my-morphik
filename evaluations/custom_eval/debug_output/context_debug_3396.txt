Will deregulation make a difference in the real economy? 
While Congressional legislation will likely be a 
challenge, deregulation is quietly delivering a positive 
impact on the banking sector. We think investors may 
underestimate its benefits. 
Currently, large U.S. banks have built more than $200 
billion of excess capital over current requirements. 
Now that capital rules are likely to be softened, this 
excess is likely to be deployed across three channels: 
private sector loan growth, share buybacks and 
banking sector consolidation. 
The first channel, private sector loan growth, is a priority 
of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Before the 
tariff shock, commercial and industrial loan demand was 
inflecting higher, and the Trump administration would 
like to accelerate the pace. On the buyback front, in Q1, 
Goldman Sachs announced a share repurchase plan 
worth 26% of its market capitalization. 
Additionally, we expect that cost synergies, the benefits 
of scaling up compliance technology demands and 
geographic diversification will spur further banking 
sector consolidation. U.S. regulators recently approved 
Capital One’s purchase of Discover, which could bode 
well for bank M&A activity. 
Bank stocks should benefit over the medium term, and 
existing preferred equity could be supported by less 
supply going forward. Indeed, if the Trump administration 
begins to focus on the pro-growth aspects of its agenda in 
the second half of 2025, bank stocks may be among the 
high-profile beneficiaries.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
SHOULD INVESTORS CHEER OR FEAR TRUMP 2.0?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Will tech stocks get 
a second wind? 
Tech and tech-adjacent stocks have an outsized 
influence on U.S. equity market performance. As of 
May 9, the technology sector is down over 8%, and the 
Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks have fallen over 12% year­
to-date. 
But tech stocks could get a second wind: Company 
earnings are strong, and valuations are not excessive. 
What’s more, we’re big believers in the long-term 
potential of AI, as we explore in a later section. 
The Magnificent 7 is expected to deliver 15% EPS growth 
in 2025 versus 8% EPS growth for the rest of the market. 
So far this year, the tech stars have underperformed 
the rest of the S&P 500, as investors worried that the 
companies’ capex plans might be too aggressive. 
On the valuation front, the Mag 7 stocks do not appear 
cheap, at a 26x forward price-to-earnings multiple 
(versus 20x for the broad market). But valuations 
relative to the rest of the market are at their lowest 
levels of the last 10 years. Another positive signal is the 
Trump Administration’s decision to exempt, for now, 
semiconductors and other electronic products from 
tariffs. Indeed, the United States enjoys a tremendous 
comparative advantage in technological innovation. 
Eroding that strength by raising the cost of tech inputs 
would be misguided, in our view. 
To return to our opening question: Should investors 
cheer or fear Trump 2.0? Tariff policy and the 
uncertainty it generates will pressure economic growth 
and corporate profits for the better part of the coming 
year, we believe. But that may not stop a bull market. 
The administration’s more investor-friendly proposals 
(including lower interest rates, lower energy prices and 
less regulation) may well materialize in the second half 
of 2025. 
Investors should get comfortable with uncertainty and 
volatility. Choppy markets may last for a while, but 
key developed market equity markets (United States, 
Europe, Japan) should make new highs by the middle 
of next year. After all, equity markets love to climb the 
proverbial “wall of worry.”

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to higher revenue and
timing of cash collections.
Cash used in investing activities decreased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by lower net
purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, mainly due to higher share
repurchases.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. As of April 27, 2025, we had $53.7
billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next
twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly-rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable
securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
Except for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at
the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We plan to make two
estimated federal and state tax payments in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, a substantial increase as compared with no estimated tax payments in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2026.
Capital Return to Shareholders
We repurchased 126 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized,
subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
SHOULD INVESTORS CHEER OR FEAR TRUMP 2.0?
 
 
 
As we’ve said – and as investors well know – the pain 
of Trump 2.0 arrived early for markets. U.S. policy 
uncertainty has spiked, and business and household 
confidence has collapsed, largely due to on-again, off-
again announcements around tariff policy. Meanwhile, 
the expected market benefits of Trump 2.0 – increased 
M&A and capital market activity, additional corporate 
tax cuts and extensive deregulation – have so far failed 
to materialize. 
No one can predict the ultimate size, scope or duration 
of future tariffs, by the United States or its trading 
partners. But their general outlines clearly signal an 
abrupt and chaotic reversal of the post–World War 
II trend toward free trade. Of all the administration’s 
policies, tariffs spark the greatest investor unease. That’s 
because higher tariffs, all else equal, lead to slower 
growth, higher prices and lower corporate profits. 
Our latest thinking suggests that the U.S. effective tariff 
rate (after deals, exclusions and substitution effects are 
accounted for) will settle in the mid-teens. That would 
be the highest levels since the Smoot-Hawley era of the 
early 1930s. Despite tariffs, we believe the U.S. economy 
can manage slightly positive growth, with corporate 
earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits over 
the next 12 months. Tariff rates that remained at their 
initial “Liberation Day” levels (the April 2 introduction of 
new U.S. tariffs) would be enough to knock the U.S. and 
likely global economies into recession this year.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
 
 
 
  
Most of Wall Street expected an immediate revival in 
dealmaking and capital market activity in the wake of 
Donald Trump’s electoral victory. From election night 
until the end of January, the capital markets subsector 
(which includes investment banks and alternative 
asset managers) rallied 10%, doubling the broad 
market’s 5% rally. 
Hopes of a dealmaking boom soon met the reality of 
tariff-driven uncertainty, still-elevated interest rates 
and choppy equity markets. While private market 
dealmaking continues at a reasonable pace, the public 
market arena (notably IPOs) has been very quiet. 
The capital markets sector has surrendered most of its 
post-election gains, and expectations for completed U.S. 
M&A activity have been revised down from 25% growth 
to just 7% growth.18 We spotted green shoots to start 
the year (global M&A activity rose 17% year-over-year 
in the first quarter, driven by sponsor-backed activity). 
But the prospect of prolonged uncertainty has created 
a cloudier outlook on the pace for dealmaking, at least 
over the near term.
