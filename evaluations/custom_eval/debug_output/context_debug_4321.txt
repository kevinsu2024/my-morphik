In addition to controls targeting D:4 and D:5 countries, the USG has also imposed worldwide export controls impacting our products, and may impose additional
controls in the future. On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the
IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a,
4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data
center products, such as our H200 and GB200. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status,
and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals.
In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the
forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could
have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our competitive position has been harmed by export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there
are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers
purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service
obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the
USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose
not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support
efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in
China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements.
For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example
by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking
and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. Such
government mandates in chip designs could introduce system vulnerabilities and expose us to significant risk and potential liability, negatively impact demand for
our products, and could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Open-source foundation models are rapidly growing in popularity with developers worldwide. Any regulatory control or other restriction that limits our ability to
provide products and services that support third-party applications and models, including applications built on foundation models originating in China such as
DeepSeek or Qwen, could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it
may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S.
and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in
markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused
in and distributed from Hong Kong.
Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our
GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream
parties to create large clusters for frontier model training.
Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of
our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China
and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they
are able to serve markets worldwide. Export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our
customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results.
As a result, export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin
America, and Southeast Asia. Export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S.

products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and
warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our
business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly
likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to
similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and
semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,
repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide
services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even
outside China.
Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related
supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our
research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to
serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide
our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about
our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example,
regulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If
regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties,
restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our
operations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside
the United States.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and
supercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed
us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in
the Middle East.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and
D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply
to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China.
On April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies
headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect
bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with
H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.
The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance
density” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data
center market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute
market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity
and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.
We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin
shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased
inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.
The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly
important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our
competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services.
Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large
language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.
The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.
In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a

of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that
could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to
do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt
supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.
Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.

could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no
assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have
designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions
on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their
interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs, and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply
our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation,
regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to
increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and
China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP
market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from
competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA
products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation
models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and
system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such
requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers,
and partners.
Governments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop
frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year
transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already
enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.
Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of
new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to
laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties
or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the
timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively
impact our business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.
Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.
Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.
As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control
restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated

Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service providers, or CSPs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 14% of total
revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two direct customers
represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale,
resulting in excess inventory and purchase obligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in
foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
The increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek to
strictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with
partners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations may
negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.
In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United
States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also
considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.
Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.
Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage
customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing
components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing
certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new
standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the
Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,
this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results
and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our
business and financial results.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We repurchased 126 million and 99 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion and $8.0 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase
agreements in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. Our share
repurchase program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.
