Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potental lifetme value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the tme of 
contract executon and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reportng period.

subject to terminaton provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract optons will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some porton of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ ﬁnancial
