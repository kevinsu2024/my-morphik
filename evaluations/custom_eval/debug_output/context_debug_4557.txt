2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
WHY ISN’T ANYONE TALKING ABOUT AI ANYMORE?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
As influential technology analyst Ben Thompson has 
argued, the AI race is at an interesting juncture. Leading 
research labs are still incentivized to raise funds and 
invest in new models: They are competing to develop 
a model that can improve itself. At the same time, 
competition could drive prices lower, which encourages 
differentiation and further adoption.15 
We think agentic AI, programs that can operate with a 
human-like level of intelligence and independence, will 
likely dominate the next wave of software. We believe 
market leaders will deliver both a better consumer 
experience and productivity gains for enterprises 
across sectors and geographies. 
Indeed, the tech sectors in Europe and China were 
closing the performance gap with U.S.-based tech 
companies – after the release of ChatGPT in November 
2022 and before the tariff shock hit markets. Finally, 
private market exposure is crucial to accessing the trend 
of AI expansion. Out of nearly 100,000 investable 
software companies, only ~4,000 are public.16 
The ultimate winners of the AI race may not yet exist. 
The rise of cloud computing and the transition to mobile 
phones in the 2010s created more than 30 companies 
with greater than US$1 billion in annual revenues 
(accounting for over US$1.9 trillion in public market 
capitalization).17 The total addressable market for AI-
related applications could surpass both the cloud and 
mobile transitions, largely because the ultimate target is 
employee compensation costs. 
Skeptics of the AI boom point to the dot-com bubble 
of the late 1990s. Before the bubble popped in 2000, 
many companies sported excessive valuations premised 
on business models that proved to be inadequate or 
non-existent. And even companies with viable business 
models struggled to justify their peak valuations. The 
U.S. and European telecoms that built most of today’s 
communication infrastructure (mobile, broadband, 
fiber optic networks) have never regained their 2000 
peaks, even as cell phone subscriptions have increased 
over tenfold. 
In our view, neither the levels of AI capex nor stock 
valuations suggest an AI bubble in the market. Stock 
prices have risen with earnings, and capex has not been 
financed with equity or debt issuance. But we are closely 
monitoring payback on AI projects and pockets of froth 
(in valuations and/or capex levels) in sectors such as 
data centers. 
The most recent earnings data suggests that AI is 
starting to deliver for companies and investors. AI 
demand contributed nearly half of the 35% growth 
reported by Microsoft’s cloud computing unit, and the 
company processed over 100 trillion AI tokens in the 
first quarter, a 5x increase from last year. 
We will continue to focus on companies and sectors 
poised to benefit from cost savings and productivity 
gains from AI technology (e.g., software and financials). 
We will also look for promising names in the agentic 
application space. 
People may not be talking about AI anymore, but they 
should be.

We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity
and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.
We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin
shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased
inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.
The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly
important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our
competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services.
Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large
language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.
The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.
In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a
worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z
ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200
and GB200. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements
of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that
could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to
do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt
supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.
Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.

The uncertainty surrounding tariff policy has distracted 
investors from another important secular trend: 
artificial intelligence. 
Even before “Liberation Day,” AI-linked stocks hit a wall 
during the March sell-off in U.S. equity markets. Twenty 
companies – nearly two-thirds of them exposed to AI – 
accounted for 80% of the year-to-date peak-to-trough 
losses in the S&P 500 before April 2. 
No one could miss the spark for the AI stock sell-off: 
Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a new AI model. 
(Two quick definitions: Models are a category of 
software, while the semiconductor chips that power the 
models are hardware.) 
DeepSeek challenged many of investors’ prevailing 
assumptions about the resources needed to develop 
high-performing AI models (e.g., capital, leading-edge 
semiconductor chips and power). In other words, 
DeepSeek could accomplish quite a lot, and at a much 
lower cost than its competitors. 
In the wake of the DeepSeek news, investors questioned 
whether the so-called hyperscalers (providers of cloud

computing, operators of data centers) would continue 
their aggressive capex – and whether, and when, these 
investments would pay off. 
Hyperscalers, including Amazon and Meta, say they are 
full steam ahead. Wall Street analysts are now penciling 
in nearly 33% capex growth from the four major 
hyperscalers over 2025 versus estimates of just over 
20% capex growth at the start of the year.14 
Confidence in greater 
AI-driven productivity 
We feel confident that AI will catalyze substantial 
productivity gains for businesses, consumers and the 
economy as a whole. Large language models can now 
deliver PhD-level outputs, while their costs have declined 
by between 80% and 99%. Further, users are increasingly 
able to optimize their mixes of cost and performance. 
Economic history is replete with examples of technologies 
that enabled adoption after costs declined dramatically 
(e.g., the Bessemer process of mass producing steel 
from molten iron, air travel, personal computers and 
semiconductors, mobile phones).
