=== CONTEXT DEBUG FOR QUESTION ===
Question: Under the Tariff Policy Uncertainty framework described in JPMorgan’s midyear report, what share of the 20 stocks driving 80% of the S&P 500’s year-to-date peak-to-trough losses were AI-exposed, what capex growth rate do analysts pencil in for the four major hyperscalers, and what percentage of the investable software universe is public?

The uncertainty surrounding tariff policy has distracted 
investors from another important secular trend: 
artificial intelligence. 
Even before “Liberation Day,” AI-linked stocks hit a wall 
during the March sell-off in U.S. equity markets. Twenty 
companies – nearly two-thirds of them exposed to AI – 
accounted for 80% of the year-to-date peak-to-trough 
losses in the S&P 500 before April 2. 
No one could miss the spark for the AI stock sell-off: 
Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a new AI model. 
(Two quick definitions: Models are a category of 
software, while the semiconductor chips that power the 
models are hardware.) 
DeepSeek challenged many of investors’ prevailing 
assumptions about the resources needed to develop 
high-performing AI models (e.g., capital, leading-edge 
semiconductor chips and power). In other words, 
DeepSeek could accomplish quite a lot, and at a much 
lower cost than its competitors. 
In the wake of the DeepSeek news, investors questioned 
whether the so-called hyperscalers (providers of cloud

computing, operators of data centers) would continue 
their aggressive capex – and whether, and when, these 
investments would pay off. 
Hyperscalers, including Amazon and Meta, say they are 
full steam ahead. Wall Street analysts are now penciling 
in nearly 33% capex growth from the four major 
hyperscalers over 2025 versus estimates of just over 
20% capex growth at the start of the year.14 
Confidence in greater 
AI-driven productivity 
We feel confident that AI will catalyze substantial 
productivity gains for businesses, consumers and the 
economy as a whole. Large language models can now 
deliver PhD-level outputs, while their costs have declined 
by between 80% and 99%. Further, users are increasingly 
able to optimize their mixes of cost and performance. 
Economic history is replete with examples of technologies 
that enabled adoption after costs declined dramatically 
(e.g., the Bessemer process of mass producing steel 
from molten iron, air travel, personal computers and 
semiconductors, mobile phones).

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
SHOULD INVESTORS CHEER OR FEAR TRUMP 2.0?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Will tech stocks get 
a second wind? 
Tech and tech-adjacent stocks have an outsized 
influence on U.S. equity market performance. As of 
May 9, the technology sector is down over 8%, and the 
Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks have fallen over 12% year­
to-date. 
But tech stocks could get a second wind: Company 
earnings are strong, and valuations are not excessive. 
What’s more, we’re big believers in the long-term 
potential of AI, as we explore in a later section. 
The Magnificent 7 is expected to deliver 15% EPS growth 
in 2025 versus 8% EPS growth for the rest of the market. 
So far this year, the tech stars have underperformed 
the rest of the S&P 500, as investors worried that the 
companies’ capex plans might be too aggressive. 
On the valuation front, the Mag 7 stocks do not appear 
cheap, at a 26x forward price-to-earnings multiple 
(versus 20x for the broad market). But valuations 
relative to the rest of the market are at their lowest 
levels of the last 10 years. Another positive signal is the 
Trump Administration’s decision to exempt, for now, 
semiconductors and other electronic products from 
tariffs. Indeed, the United States enjoys a tremendous 
comparative advantage in technological innovation. 
Eroding that strength by raising the cost of tech inputs 
would be misguided, in our view. 
To return to our opening question: Should investors 
cheer or fear Trump 2.0? Tariff policy and the 
uncertainty it generates will pressure economic growth 
and corporate profits for the better part of the coming 
year, we believe. But that may not stop a bull market. 
The administration’s more investor-friendly proposals 
(including lower interest rates, lower energy prices and 
less regulation) may well materialize in the second half 
of 2025. 
Investors should get comfortable with uncertainty and 
volatility. Choppy markets may last for a while, but 
key developed market equity markets (United States, 
Europe, Japan) should make new highs by the middle 
of next year. After all, equity markets love to climb the 
proverbial “wall of worry.”

As influential technology analyst Ben Thompson has 
argued, the AI race is at an interesting juncture. Leading 
research labs are still incentivized to raise funds and 
invest in new models: They are competing to develop 
a model that can improve itself. At the same time, 
competition could drive prices lower, which encourages 
differentiation and further adoption.15 
We think agentic AI, programs that can operate with a 
human-like level of intelligence and independence, will 
likely dominate the next wave of software. We believe 
market leaders will deliver both a better consumer 
experience and productivity gains for enterprises 
across sectors and geographies. 
Indeed, the tech sectors in Europe and China were 
closing the performance gap with U.S.-based tech 
companies – after the release of ChatGPT in November 
2022 and before the tariff shock hit markets. Finally, 
private market exposure is crucial to accessing the trend 
of AI expansion. Out of nearly 100,000 investable 
software companies, only ~4,000 are public.16 
The ultimate winners of the AI race may not yet exist. 
The rise of cloud computing and the transition to mobile 
phones in the 2010s created more than 30 companies 
with greater than US$1 billion in annual revenues 
(accounting for over US$1.9 trillion in public market 
capitalization).17 The total addressable market for AI-
related applications could surpass both the cloud and 
mobile transitions, largely because the ultimate target is 
employee compensation costs. 
Skeptics of the AI boom point to the dot-com bubble 
of the late 1990s. Before the bubble popped in 2000, 
many companies sported excessive valuations premised 
on business models that proved to be inadequate or 
non-existent. And even companies with viable business 
models struggled to justify their peak valuations. The 
U.S. and European telecoms that built most of today’s 
communication infrastructure (mobile, broadband, 
fiber optic networks) have never regained their 2000 
peaks, even as cell phone subscriptions have increased 
over tenfold. 
In our view, neither the levels of AI capex nor stock 
valuations suggest an AI bubble in the market. Stock 
prices have risen with earnings, and capex has not been 
financed with equity or debt issuance. But we are closely 
monitoring payback on AI projects and pockets of froth 
(in valuations and/or capex levels) in sectors such as 
data centers. 
The most recent earnings data suggests that AI is 
starting to deliver for companies and investors. AI 
demand contributed nearly half of the 35% growth 
reported by Microsoft’s cloud computing unit, and the 
company processed over 100 trillion AI tokens in the 
first quarter, a 5x increase from last year. 
We will continue to focus on companies and sectors 
poised to benefit from cost savings and productivity 
gains from AI technology (e.g., software and financials).

Investors are skittish – and who can blame them? The 
building blocks they had taken for granted – a durable 
economic expansion, limited new barriers to global 
trade and continued spending on artificial intelligence 
(AI) – are suddenly at risk. Lofty expectations at the 
start of the year have collided with a far rougher reality. 
“Uncertainty” is the now ubiquitous word for businesses 
weighing capital investment, households pondering the 
next big purchase, central banks setting interest rate 
policy and investors making asset-allocation decisions. 
In our Mid-Year Outlook, we aim to answer five essential 
questions that could help you unlock opportunity in 
uncertainty and stay focused on your wealth plan. 
1. Should investors cheer or fear Trump 2.0? 
2. Is your portfolio resilient to growing risks? 
3. Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar? 
4. Why isn’t anyone talking about AI anymore? 
5. What’s the deal with dealmaking? 
Investors were not asking as many questions six months 
ago. Many of them initially cheered the incoming U.S. 
administration, which they believed would be pro-growth 
and investor friendly. That no longer seems a sure thing. 
The sequencing of policies has been a surprise. 
Consensus expectations envisioned pro-growth 
policies dominating the Trump administration’s 
agenda. Instead, the least market-friendly policies 
(higher tariffs, less immigration and austerity through 
Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE]– 
orchestrated government spending cuts) are taking 
effect quickly. Investors are focusing in particular on the 
administration’s chaotic tariff strategy and the potential 
for the levies to constrain growth and boost inflation. 
Meanwhile, Congress is contemplating a tax bill that 
could add nearly $6 trillion to the budget deficit over 
the next 10 years. The benefits of deregulation have 
yet to emerge. Capital markets activity remains largely 
dormant – IPO activity in both value and volume has 
been slower than in 2024 and 2023. 
The market bounty, in other words, has yet to arrive, 
and returns across assets look very different than they 
did last year.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
 
 
 
  
Most of Wall Street expected an immediate revival in 
dealmaking and capital market activity in the wake of 
Donald Trump’s electoral victory. From election night 
until the end of January, the capital markets subsector 
(which includes investment banks and alternative 
asset managers) rallied 10%, doubling the broad 
market’s 5% rally. 
Hopes of a dealmaking boom soon met the reality of 
tariff-driven uncertainty, still-elevated interest rates 
and choppy equity markets. While private market 
dealmaking continues at a reasonable pace, the public 
market arena (notably IPOs) has been very quiet. 
The capital markets sector has surrendered most of its 
post-election gains, and expectations for completed U.S. 
M&A activity have been revised down from 25% growth 
to just 7% growth.18 We spotted green shoots to start 
the year (global M&A activity rose 17% year-over-year 
in the first quarter, driven by sponsor-backed activity). 
But the prospect of prolonged uncertainty has created 
a cloudier outlook on the pace for dealmaking, at least 
over the near term.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar 
We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most 
troubled developed market is the United Kingdom, 
where investors seem to have become disillusioned 
with fiscal policy. In 2025, the noise surrounding the 
dollar has been greater than the observed market 
stress, despite the dramatic moves in the middle of 
April. So far in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen 
simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds 
and currencies. 
In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline. 
Investors still have time to mitigate the impacts on 
their portfolios. 
IN RECENT YEARS, INVESTORS HAVE SOLD U.K. ASSETS MUCH MORE 
FREQUENTLY THAN U.S. ASSETS
