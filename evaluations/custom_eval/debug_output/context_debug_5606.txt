=== CONTEXT DEBUG FOR QUESTION ===
Question: By how many percentage points did the share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currency fall in 2025 relative to the three-year average, by how many percentage points has equity allocation drift increased since 2020, and which currency continues to hold the largest share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves?

Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar 
We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most 
troubled developed market is the United Kingdom, 
where investors seem to have become disillusioned 
with fiscal policy. In 2025, the noise surrounding the 
dollar has been greater than the observed market 
stress, despite the dramatic moves in the middle of 
April. So far in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen 
simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds 
and currencies. 
In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline. 
Investors still have time to mitigate the impacts on 
their portfolios.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
The primacy of the dollar seems durable, but at the 
margin, investors may be shifting their perceptions of 
the dollar’s value. Nearly 70% of investors surveyed 
think the dollar is “overvalued,” and a net 61%, the 
highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to 
depreciate.11 Our base case is that the dollar loses a few 
more percentage points by the end of the year against 
major currencies, with risks tilted to the downside. 
The historical precedents of sustained dollar weakness 
(1970–1980, 1985–1992 and 2002–2008) resulted in 
~40% depreciation over a 5- to 10-year period. Academic 
estimates suggest that ex-U.S. investors own ~30% of 
U.S.-issued fixed income and equity (public and private) 
securities.12 Even marginal repatriation could result 
in a significant change in relative valuations between 
U.S. and rest-of-world assets. 
Diversifying currency exposure can mitigate potential 
losses associated with dollar depreciation. We are 
focused on the euro, Japanese yen and gold due to 
their size, liquidity and historical roles as alternative 
reserve assets. Central banks, with nearly $13 trillion in 
reserves, have already increased allocations to these 
currencies, reflecting their deep, liquid markets and 
potential for preserving purchasing power. The euro 
and yen also have a lower correlation to global growth, 
which reduces cyclical exposure within a portfolio. 
Currency diversification probably comes more naturally 
to investors outside of the United States than to those 
inside the United States. The path of least resistance 
for U.S.-based investors could be exposure to equities 
denominated in the euro and yen. In fact, J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market 
Assumptions suggest that U.S. dollar depreciation will 
add 1%–2% annually to total returns for European and 
Japanese equity investments in U.S. dollar terms for the 
next 10–15 years. 
Importantly, those equity markets are also expected 
to outperform the United States on an absolute basis. 
Investing in private equity investments could also be a 
way to diversify geographic and currency exposure. U.S. 
equities make up between 70% and 75% of public equity 
benchmarks, but they account for only half of global 
buyout volumes.13 
Investors may also consider foreign currency 
denominated bonds, but they should understand the 
risks involved. A dollar-based investor in an unhedged 
ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 
2x the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio 
over the last 20 years.

All that glitters is gold? 
In our view, gold may be positioned to offer some

dollar weakness. 
Although the price of gold has rallied strongly in the past 
few years, we think it can continue. Many central banks 
(e.g., Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Japan, China, Singapore, Brazil 
and Korea) have less than 7% of their foreign reserves in 
gold. In comparison, Germany and the United States each 
hold over 75% of their reserves in gold.8 
Enthusiasts disagree, but we are skeptical that Bitcoin 
and other crypto assets offer the potential to improve 
portfolio resilience. Despite their low correlations to 
traditional assets, crypto assets have historically made 
portfolios more fragile. 
Cryptocurrency is also much more volatile than gold. A 
5% addition of cryptocurrency to a balanced portfolio 
can result in a significantly higher risk contribution 
than a 5% addition to gold. Yes, crypto may soon find a 
friendlier regulatory regime, but this seems unlikely 
to change the asset class’s fundamental characteristics, 
at least in the near term. 
Whatever happens in markets, basic portfolio “hygiene” 
can improve resilience. Consider portfolio “drift.” A 60% 
equity/40% fixed income portfolio from 2020 will have 
drifted to something closer to 75%/25% today. 
And given the outperformance of U.S. assets over the 
last five years, portfolios may have become overly 
concentrated in U.S. dollar assets. A resilient portfolio 
will address market drift in a timely fashion.

Where do we go from here? 
Economic fundamentals appear solid for now, although

Investors are skittish – and who can blame them? The 
building blocks they had taken for granted – a durable 
economic expansion, limited new barriers to global 
trade and continued spending on artificial intelligence 
(AI) – are suddenly at risk. Lofty expectations at the 
start of the year have collided with a far rougher reality. 
“Uncertainty” is the now ubiquitous word for businesses 
weighing capital investment, households pondering the 
next big purchase, central banks setting interest rate 
policy and investors making asset-allocation decisions. 
In our Mid-Year Outlook, we aim to answer five essential 
questions that could help you unlock opportunity in 
uncertainty and stay focused on your wealth plan. 
1. Should investors cheer or fear Trump 2.0? 
2. Is your portfolio resilient to growing risks? 
3. Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar? 
4. Why isn’t anyone talking about AI anymore? 
5. What’s the deal with dealmaking? 
Investors were not asking as many questions six months 
ago. Many of them initially cheered the incoming U.S. 
administration, which they believed would be pro-growth 
and investor friendly. That no longer seems a sure thing. 
The sequencing of policies has been a surprise. 
Consensus expectations envisioned pro-growth 
policies dominating the Trump administration’s 
agenda. Instead, the least market-friendly policies 
(higher tariffs, less immigration and austerity through 
Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE]– 
orchestrated government spending cuts) are taking 
effect quickly. Investors are focusing in particular on the 
administration’s chaotic tariff strategy and the potential 
for the levies to constrain growth and boost inflation. 
Meanwhile, Congress is contemplating a tax bill that 
could add nearly $6 trillion to the budget deficit over 
the next 10 years. The benefits of deregulation have 
yet to emerge. Capital markets activity remains largely 
dormant – IPO activity in both value and volume has 
been slower than in 2024 and 2023. 
The market bounty, in other words, has yet to arrive, 
and returns across assets look very different than they 
did last year.

Investors are skittish – and who can blame them? The 
building blocks they had taken for granted – a durable 
economic expansion, limited new barriers to global 
trade and continued spending on artificial intelligence 
(AI) – are suddenly at risk. Lofty expectations at the 
start of the year have collided with a far rougher reality.

“Uncertainty” is the now ubiquitous word for businesses 
weighing capital investment, households pondering the 
next big purchase, central banks setting interest rate 
policy and investors making asset-allocation decisions.

In our Mid-Year Outlook, we aim to answer five essential 
questions that could help you unlock opportunity in 
uncertainty and stay focused on your wealth plan.

1. Should investors cheer or fear Trump 2.0?

2. Is your portfolio resilient to growing risks?

3. Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar?

4. Why isn’t anyone talking about AI anymore?

5. What’s the deal with dealmaking?

Investors were not asking as many questions six months 
ago. Many of them initially cheered the incoming U.S. 
administration, which they believed would be pro-growth 
and investor friendly. That no longer seems a sure thing.

The sequencing of policies has been a surprise. 
Consensus expectations envisioned pro-growth 
policies dominating the Trump administration’s 
agenda. Instead, the least market-friendly policies 
(higher tariffs, less immigration and austerity through 
Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE]– 
orchestrated government spending cuts) are taking 
effect quickly. Investors are focusing in particular on the 
administration’s chaotic tariff strategy and the potential 
for the levies to constrain growth and boost inflation.

Meanwhile, Congress is contemplating a tax bill that 
could add nearly $6 trillion to the budget deficit over 
the next 10 years. The benefits of deregulation have 
yet to emerge. Capital markets activity remains largely 
dormant – IPO activity in both value and volume has 
been slower than in 2024 and 2023.

The market bounty, in other words, has yet to arrive, 
and returns across assets look very different than they 
did last year.
