=== CONTEXT DEBUG FOR QUESTION ===
Question: What is the ratio of the U.S. dollar's share of global central bank foreign exchange reserves in 2024 to the euro's share of SWIFT settlements, and by how many percentage points does the dollar's share of SWIFT trade finance settlements exceed its share of international debt?

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The recent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar has 
sparked spirited debate. Does weakness in the dollar 
call into question its role as the world’s reserve currency 
and, more broadly, the status of the United States as a 
hegemon in the global economy? Or does the decline 
signal a significant but not existential change? 
We’re inclined to take the second view, as we 
discuss below. 
The U.S. dollar has long served as the world’s reserve 
currency, and for good reason. The United States 
commands the largest9 and most stable economy in 
the world, and the deepest and most liquid financial 
markets. It has a well-established and consistent rule 
of law, strong institutions, fair and free elections, 
open and transparent political processes, relatively 
consistent regulatory and tax regimes, and a culture 
of innovation and entrepreneurship. The U.S. military 
provides the security backbone that underpins the 
global economic system. 
However, every reserve currency, from the Spanish 
galleon to the British pound, has eventually lost 
its primacy. Today, the dollar seems to face more 
potential downside risks than it has in decades. So 
far this year, the dollar has lost value relative to every 
other major currency. Tariff rollouts and trade policy 
uncertainty are parts of the story. But investors are also 
concerned about the U.S. fiscal outlook amid potential 
Congressional legislation that could substantially 
increase the budget deficit. 
The risk for markets is that U.S. policymakers repeat 
the mistakes of Latin American leaders such as former 
Argentinian President Juan Peron: protectionism, lack 
of central bank independence and a broader disregard 
for macroeconomic stability. Ironically, many Latin 
American economies have made substantial progress in 
these areas just as market participants are increasingly 
questioning U.S. economic credibility.    
But we believe those risks will manifest in a more 
subtle erosion of the dollar’s value, and not a sudden 
collapse. Today, the dollar makes up 60% of foreign 
exchange reserves, 65% of international debt and nearly 
85% of SWIFT trade finance settlements. Network effects 
are powerful; moving to a new medium for international 
trade and financing likely would not occur quickly. The 
second most used currency, the euro, accounts for just 
6% of SWIFT settlements.10

IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
The primacy of the dollar seems durable, but at the 
margin, investors may be shifting their perceptions of 
the dollar’s value. Nearly 70% of investors surveyed 
think the dollar is “overvalued,” and a net 61%, the 
highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to 
depreciate.11 Our base case is that the dollar loses a few 
more percentage points by the end of the year against 
major currencies, with risks tilted to the downside. 
The historical precedents of sustained dollar weakness 
(1970–1980, 1985–1992 and 2002–2008) resulted in 
~40% depreciation over a 5- to 10-year period. Academic 
estimates suggest that ex-U.S. investors own ~30% of 
U.S.-issued fixed income and equity (public and private) 
securities.12 Even marginal repatriation could result 
in a significant change in relative valuations between 
U.S. and rest-of-world assets. 
Diversifying currency exposure can mitigate potential 
losses associated with dollar depreciation. We are 
focused on the euro, Japanese yen and gold due to 
their size, liquidity and historical roles as alternative 
reserve assets. Central banks, with nearly $13 trillion in 
reserves, have already increased allocations to these 
currencies, reflecting their deep, liquid markets and 
potential for preserving purchasing power. The euro 
and yen also have a lower correlation to global growth, 
which reduces cyclical exposure within a portfolio. 
Currency diversification probably comes more naturally 
to investors outside of the United States than to those 
inside the United States. The path of least resistance 
for U.S.-based investors could be exposure to equities 
denominated in the euro and yen. In fact, J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market 
Assumptions suggest that U.S. dollar depreciation will 
add 1%–2% annually to total returns for European and 
Japanese equity investments in U.S. dollar terms for the 
next 10–15 years. 
Importantly, those equity markets are also expected 
to outperform the United States on an absolute basis. 
Investing in private equity investments could also be a 
way to diversify geographic and currency exposure. U.S. 
equities make up between 70% and 75% of public equity 
benchmarks, but they account for only half of global 
buyout volumes.13 
Investors may also consider foreign currency 
denominated bonds, but they should understand the 
risks involved. A dollar-based investor in an unhedged 
ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 
2x the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio 
over the last 20 years.

Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar 
We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most 
troubled developed market is the United Kingdom, 
where investors seem to have become disillusioned 
with fiscal policy. In 2025, the noise surrounding the 
dollar has been greater than the observed market 
stress, despite the dramatic moves in the middle of 
April. So far in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen 
simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds 
and currencies. 
In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline.

their portfolios.

In our view, gold may be positioned to offer some

Although the price of gold has rallied strongly in the past 
few years, we think it can continue. Many central banks 
(e.g., Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Japan, China, Singapore, Brazil

Cryptocurrency is also much more volatile than gold. A 
5% addition of cryptocurrency to a balanced portfolio

Whatever happens in markets, basic portfolio “hygiene” 
can improve resilience. Consider portfolio “drift.” A 60% 
equity/40% fixed income portfolio from 2020 will have 
drifted to something closer to 75%/25% today. 
And given the outperformance of U.S. assets over the

concentrated in U.S. dollar assets. A resilient portfolio 
will address market drift in a timely fashion.

Investors are weighing dissonant risks to growth and inflation. Higher barriers to trade could raise prices, 
slow growth and hurt equity valuations. On the other hand, stimulative fiscal policy from the United States, 
China and Europe could place upward pressure on bond yields. It is difficult to predict the net impact of all 
these factors. But our analysis suggests that if the final Congressional legislation matches Senate instructions 
and dollar weakness continues, inflation could move higher over the next year.

Note: This chart utilizes the Fed’s FRB/U.S. macro econometric model to assess the inflationary impact from several key vectors, including forward-looking assumptions. 
1) We assume the fiscal reconciliation package passed this year meets the maximum cumulative deficit impact ($5.8 trillion) as outlined by the Senate’s budget resolution 
instructions. 2) We assume a 2% hit to real GDP from the tariffs announced year-to-date, which results in the unemployment rate rising just under 1%. 3) We assume a 
-10% depreciation in the broad real effective U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
Whether inflation, growth or markets move up, down or 
sideways, portfolio resilience – a key theme of our 2025 
outlook – can help clients reach their wealth goals. 
Before we get into the specifics of portfolio resilience, 
let’s step back and consider a longer-term perspective. 
In the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era (roughly 
2009–2020), portfolios gravitated to assets, primarily 
U.S. equities, which worked well in an environment 
of low inflation, low interest rates and modest 
volatility. Today, investors face two-way risks to 
growth and inflation, and what looks to be persistent 
policy uncertainty. It’s a regime shift, with important 
implications for building resilient portfolios. 
How do we think about portfolio resilience in the 
current environment? In our view, a resilient portfolio 
includes assets with low or negative correlations to each 
other, each with an intrinsic ability to outperform cash. 
Collectively, the assets offer the potential to mitigate the 
severity of portfolio-level drawdowns. Of course, core 
fixed income remains the primary source of portfolio 
resilience in a growth downturn. Opportunistic credit 
strategies could capitalize in periods of economic stress. 
Here, we discuss four attractive asset choices that 
could help make portfolios more resilient against the 
countervailing risks: equity-linked structured notes, 
hedge funds, infrastructure and gold.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK

Investors are weighing dissonant risks to growth and inflation. Higher barriers to trade could raise prices, 
slow growth and hurt equity valuations. On the other hand, stimulative fiscal policy from the United States, 
China and Europe could place upward pressure on bond yields. It is difficult to predict the net impact of all 
these factors. But our analysis suggests that if the final Congressional legislation matches Senate instructions 
and dollar weakness continues, inflation could move higher over the next year.

Note: This chart utilizes the Fed’s FRB/U.S. macro econometric model to assess the inflationary impact from several key vectors, including forward-looking assumptions. 
1) We assume the fiscal reconciliation package passed this year meets the maximum cumulative deficit impact ($5.8 trillion) as outlined by the Senate’s budget resolution 
instructions. 2) We assume a 2% hit to real GDP from the tariffs announced year-to-date, which results in the unemployment rate rising just under 1%. 3) We assume a 
-10% depreciation in the broad real effective U.S. dollar exchange rate.

Whether inflation, growth or markets move up, down or 
sideways, portfolio resilience – a key theme of our 2025 
outlook – can help clients reach their wealth goals.

Before we get into the specifics of portfolio resilience, 
let’s step back and consider a longer-term perspective. 
In the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era (roughly 
2009–2020), portfolios gravitated to assets, primarily 
U.S. equities, which worked well in an environment 
of low inflation, low interest rates and modest 
volatility. Today, investors face two-way risks to 
growth and inflation, and what looks to be persistent 
policy uncertainty. It’s a regime shift, with important 
implications for building resilient portfolios.

How do we think about portfolio resilience in the 
current environment? In our view, a resilient portfolio 
includes assets with low or negative correlations to each 
other, each with an intrinsic ability to outperform cash. 
Collectively, the assets offer the potential to mitigate the 
severity of portfolio-level drawdowns. Of course, core
