On April 9, 2025, we were informed by the USG that a license is required for exports of our H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new
requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the
demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our
H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have
impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
Revenue was $44.1 billion, up 69% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially.
Data Center revenue was $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand
for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We saw our
Blackwell architecture ramp expand to all customer categories, while large cloud service providers remained our largest at just under 50% of Data Center
revenue. Data Center compute revenue was $34.2 billion, up 76% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Networking revenue was $5.0 billion, up 56% from a
year ago and up 64% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric in our GB200 systems and continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at
cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.
Gaming revenue was up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture.
Professional Visualization revenue was up 19% from a year ago and flat sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by broader adoption of Ada RTX
workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.
Automotive revenue was up 72% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.
Gross margin decreased from a year ago and sequentially, primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations
and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Operating expenses were up 44% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits
expenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and compute, infrastructure and engineering development costs for new product introductions.
The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth.

products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and
warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our
business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly
likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to
similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and
semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,
repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide
services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even
outside China.
Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related
supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our
research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to
serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide
our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about
our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example,
regulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If
regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties,
restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our
operations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside
the United States.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and
supercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed
us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in
the Middle East.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and
D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply
to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China.
On April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies
headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect
bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with
H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.
The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance
density” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data
center market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute
market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.
On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or

Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.

On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we

We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity
and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.
We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin
shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased
inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.
The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly
important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our
competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services.
Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large
language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.
The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.
In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a
worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z
ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200
and GB200. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements
of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that
could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to
do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt
supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.
Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.

We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity
and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.

We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin
shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased
inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.

The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly
important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our
competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services.
Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large
language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.

The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.

In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a
worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z
ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200
and GB200. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements
of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that
could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to
do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt
supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.

We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.

Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.

Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.

Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Unaudited)
The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed
January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once
the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,
purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and
violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and
improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et
al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition for writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties
discuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. On March 7, 2025, the district court adopted the parties' stipulation to
extend the stay until the final and complete resolution of the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on
behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information,
corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements
related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including
disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.
Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.
2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and
insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on
GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of
unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation
action.
