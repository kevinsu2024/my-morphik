Level 2 inputs.
Our notes are unsecured senior obligations. Existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the notes. Our notes pay interest semi-
annually. We may redeem each of our notes prior to maturity, subject to a make-whole premium. The maturity of the notes is calendar year.
As of April 27, 2025, we complied with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the outstanding notes.
Commercial Paper
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of April 27, 2025, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations reflect our commitment to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply and capacity
agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets.
As of April 27, 2025, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $29.8 billion, an increase from the prior year
led by commitments, capacity and components for our Blackwell architecture. We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure
inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are cancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business
needs prior to placing firm orders. Though, changes to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were
$13.7  billion, including $10.6  billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect our cloud service agreements to primarily be used to support our
research and development efforts, as well as our DGX Cloud offerings.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January  26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of
results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
In June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Fiscal Year
Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The first quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week
quarters.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,
investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other
charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of
information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing the
effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the year ending January 25, 2026.
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,
including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within
each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections based on management’s
beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as
“may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “goal,” “would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “potential” and similar expressions intended
to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results,
performance, time frames or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, time frames or achievements expressed or implied by
the forward-looking statements. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors” of such reports. Given these risks, uncertainties, and
other factors, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and
assumptions only as of the date of this filing. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and understand that our actual future results may
be materially different from what we expect. We hereby qualify our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we
assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A.
“Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.
Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.
On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we
initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the
new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable
to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the
interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that
receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

We recognized revenue of $265 million and $188 million in the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively, that were included in the prior year end
deferred revenue balance.
As of April  27, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8  billion, which includes
$1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue. Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts
greater than one year in length will be recognized over the next twelve months.
Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign
currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. During the first quarter of
fiscal years 2026 and 2025, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not
significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign
currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of April 27, 2025 and January 26, 2025.
As of April 27, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months were not significant.
