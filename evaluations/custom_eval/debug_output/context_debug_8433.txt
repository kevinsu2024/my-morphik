=== CONTEXT DEBUG FOR QUESTION ===
Question: What percentage of historical infrastructure total returns is driven by income, what tax rates were assumed for long-term and short-term capital gains in J.P. Morgan’s after-tax hedge fund performance analysis, and by what factor has client utilization of equity-linked structured notes increased this year compared to 2024?

We believe equity-linked structured notes can work well 
in the current environment, for investors who qualify. 
Our clients seem to agree: Twice as many are utilizing 
structured notes this year relative to 2024. 
Many equity-linked structured notes pay a coupon, 
periodically or at maturity. This coupon is a function 
of implied equity market volatility and interest rates. 
We believe both will remain elevated relative to 
recent history, potentially providing greater downside 
protection, higher potential coupons, or both. 
Equity-linked structured notes create another lever that 
qualified investors can pull to generate income that is 
not correlated to fixed income markets. Indeed, these 
equity-linked structured notes can generate higher 
return potential with a narrower range of possible 
outcomes than assets with similar volatility, such as 
preferred equities and high-yield bonds. Individual 
circumstances will differ, but investors who qualify can 
consider exploring structured notes as part of their 
portfolios, potentially starting with a modest allocation. 
Alternative assets to help strengthen portfolio resilience 
Hedge funds are another asset that can potentially 
strengthen portfolio resilience for suitable investors. 
From December 2019 to August 2024, almost 80% 
of randomly generated hedge fund composites 
outperformed a simple stock/bond mix on a risk-
adjusted basis.4 Going forward, we expect diversified 
hedge fund strategies to deliver returns and volatility 
that are slightly higher than core fixed income (as 
proxied here by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index), 
with very little correlation to it.5 
Equity and credit valuations remain elevated at a 
time of uncertainty about policy, growth and inflation 
trajectories. This will likely support sustainably higher 
levels of volatility and dispersion across and within asset 
classes. Against this backdrop, we particularly favor 
less correlated hedge funds (such as relative value 
and macro), which are designed to capitalize on the 
dislocations created during periods of market turbulence. 
Finally, hedge fund returns hold up well on an after-
tax basis for U.S. investors. Market participants often 
assume that hedge funds generate short-term gains 
that erode after-tax returns. But we have found that on 
a three-, five- and 10-year rolling basis, portfolios that 
include hedge funds have outperformed those 
that do not, even on an after-tax basis.6 
We have also focused on infrastructure investments 
to provide portfolio resilience. Here, investors benefit 
from long-term contracts that often embed inflation 
protection. Further, over 40% of the historical returns 
of infrastructure investments are driven by income. 
Generating income through infrastructure may be 
especially attractive (for suitable investors) in a world 
of elevated bond market volatility. Since the second 
quarter of 2008, infrastructure has generated total 
returns in the low double digits on an annual basis.7 
Finally, we note that a secular shift toward 
greater demand for power generation and digital 
infrastructure may create new opportunities in 
the infrastructure sector. Further, more frequent 
and severe climate and weather shocks reinforce the 
growing demand for resilient infrastructure.

Investors are weighing dissonant risks to growth and inflation. Higher barriers to trade could raise prices, 
slow growth and hurt equity valuations. On the other hand, stimulative fiscal policy from the United States, 
China and Europe could place upward pressure on bond yields. It is difficult to predict the net impact of all 
these factors. But our analysis suggests that if the final Congressional legislation matches Senate instructions 
and dollar weakness continues, inflation could move higher over the next year.

Note: This chart utilizes the Fed’s FRB/U.S. macro econometric model to assess the inflationary impact from several key vectors, including forward-looking assumptions. 
1) We assume the fiscal reconciliation package passed this year meets the maximum cumulative deficit impact ($5.8 trillion) as outlined by the Senate’s budget resolution 
instructions. 2) We assume a 2% hit to real GDP from the tariffs announced year-to-date, which results in the unemployment rate rising just under 1%. 3) We assume a 
-10% depreciation in the broad real effective U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
Whether inflation, growth or markets move up, down or 
sideways, portfolio resilience – a key theme of our 2025 
outlook – can help clients reach their wealth goals. 
Before we get into the specifics of portfolio resilience, 
let’s step back and consider a longer-term perspective. 
In the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era (roughly 
2009–2020), portfolios gravitated to assets, primarily 
U.S. equities, which worked well in an environment 
of low inflation, low interest rates and modest 
volatility. Today, investors face two-way risks to 
growth and inflation, and what looks to be persistent 
policy uncertainty. It’s a regime shift, with important 
implications for building resilient portfolios. 
How do we think about portfolio resilience in the 
current environment? In our view, a resilient portfolio 
includes assets with low or negative correlations to each 
other, each with an intrinsic ability to outperform cash. 
Collectively, the assets offer the potential to mitigate the 
severity of portfolio-level drawdowns. Of course, core 
fixed income remains the primary source of portfolio 
resilience in a growth downturn. Opportunistic credit 
strategies could capitalize in periods of economic stress. 
Here, we discuss four attractive asset choices that 
could help make portfolios more resilient against the 
countervailing risks: equity-linked structured notes, 
hedge funds, infrastructure and gold.

IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
The primacy of the dollar seems durable, but at the 
margin, investors may be shifting their perceptions of 
the dollar’s value. Nearly 70% of investors surveyed 
think the dollar is “overvalued,” and a net 61%, the 
highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to 
depreciate.11 Our base case is that the dollar loses a few 
more percentage points by the end of the year against 
major currencies, with risks tilted to the downside. 
The historical precedents of sustained dollar weakness 
(1970–1980, 1985–1992 and 2002–2008) resulted in 
~40% depreciation over a 5- to 10-year period. Academic 
estimates suggest that ex-U.S. investors own ~30% of 
U.S.-issued fixed income and equity (public and private) 
securities.12 Even marginal repatriation could result 
in a significant change in relative valuations between 
U.S. and rest-of-world assets. 
Diversifying currency exposure can mitigate potential 
losses associated with dollar depreciation. We are 
focused on the euro, Japanese yen and gold due to 
their size, liquidity and historical roles as alternative 
reserve assets. Central banks, with nearly $13 trillion in 
reserves, have already increased allocations to these 
currencies, reflecting their deep, liquid markets and 
potential for preserving purchasing power. The euro 
and yen also have a lower correlation to global growth, 
which reduces cyclical exposure within a portfolio. 
Currency diversification probably comes more naturally 
to investors outside of the United States than to those 
inside the United States. The path of least resistance 
for U.S.-based investors could be exposure to equities 
denominated in the euro and yen. In fact, J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market 
Assumptions suggest that U.S. dollar depreciation will 
add 1%–2% annually to total returns for European and 
Japanese equity investments in U.S. dollar terms for the 
next 10–15 years. 
Importantly, those equity markets are also expected 
to outperform the United States on an absolute basis. 
Investing in private equity investments could also be a 
way to diversify geographic and currency exposure. U.S. 
equities make up between 70% and 75% of public equity 
benchmarks, but they account for only half of global 
buyout volumes.13 
Investors may also consider foreign currency 
denominated bonds, but they should understand the 
risks involved. A dollar-based investor in an unhedged 
ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 
2x the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio 
over the last 20 years.

A slower pace of traditional dealmaking activity (IPO, 
strategic M&A), along with aging assets in existing 
private equity portfolios, could create a compelling 
opportunity set for secondary managers that 
buy existing stakes from other sponsors. Historically, 
secondaries have been attractive for several reasons. 
First, they mitigate the “J-Curve” effect inherent in 
drawdown funds (early negative returns as capital 
is called, followed by positive returns as capital is 
distributed). In addition, secondary funds give investors 
visibility into a strategy’s underlying assets (mitigating 
blind pool risk), and provide meaningful diversification 
across vintage year and manager. The potential 
liquidity needs of college endowments is another 
potential catalyst that could lead to opportunity for 
secondary funds. 
Evergreen fund structures will likely alter the private 
market landscape. Just this year, over 4,500 clients 
have invested in evergreen structures for the first time. 
Currently, evergreen funds are ~5% of the overall private 
markets, and some estimate that share could grow to 
20% in the next decade.20 As private markets mature, 
we expect asset owners will find more opportunities 
for liquidity beyond the traditional avenues of IPOs and 
strategic M&A. 
Investors who only participate in public markets should 
realize that companies are staying private longer. Today, 
the median company that goes public is almost 14 years 
old. Ten years ago, the median age of an IPO was less 
than 11 years old.21 Of all the companies that exceed 
$100 million in annual revenue in the United States, 87% 
are private.22 
A key takeaway for suitable investors: Exposure to 
private markets could be critical to ensure proper 
exposure to the total economy. 
As the private equity ecosystem comes into better 
balance, the sports investment landscape is a notable 
bright spot. In the athletic arena, sports deals have 
continued to grow in terms of both number and 
volume. The sale of the Boston Celtics set a record for 
transaction valuation, and Peyton Manning’s sports-
focused Omaha Productions was recently valued at over 
$800 million.23 We believe the sports ecosystem could 
offer the opportunity for less correlated return streams 
across debt and equity investments. 
The private market landscape continues to evolve, 
driven by aging assets and growing evergreen funds. 
Investors should consider maintaining a balance 
between drawdown and evergreen structures as they 
build out their private equity portfolios, while also 
exploring investments in secondaries and sports.

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to higher revenue and
timing of cash collections.
Cash used in investing activities decreased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by lower net
purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, mainly due to higher share
repurchases.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. As of April 27, 2025, we had $53.7
billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next
twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly-rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable
securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
Except for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at
the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We plan to make two
estimated federal and state tax payments in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, a substantial increase as compared with no estimated tax payments in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2026.
Capital Return to Shareholders
We repurchased 126 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized,
subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.
