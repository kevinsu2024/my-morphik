Q1 2025 Highlights
The term “Strategic Commercial Contracts” is as deﬁned in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ﬁled on February 18, 2025. Rule of 40 refers to the sum of our revenue growth rate year-over-year and our adjusted operatng margin. The value of deals closed reﬂects the total contract value of contracts that have been entered 
into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers and includes existng contractual obligatons and unexercised contract optons available to those customers. Adjusted free cash ﬂow and adjusted free cash ﬂow margin exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensaton and 
purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted operatng income and adjusted operatng margin excludes stock-based compensaton expense and related employer payroll taxes. Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potental lifetme value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the tme of 
contract executon and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reportng period. Except as noted below, TCV and RDV each presume the exercise of all contract optons available to our customers and no terminaton of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are 
subject to terminaton provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract optons will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some porton of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ ﬁnancial 
conditon, including the consideraton of such customers’ ability and intenton to pay, and whether such contracts contnue to meet the criteria for revenue recogniton, among other factors. Adjusted EPS excludes stock-based compensaton expense, related employer payroll taxes, and income tax eﬀects and adjustments. 
Please see the appendix for reconciliatons of these and other non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
US commercial revenue grew +71% Y/Y and +19% Q/Q to $255 million
US revenue grew +55% Y/Y and +13% Q/Q to $628 million
US commercial remaining deal value (“RDV”) grew +127% Y/Y and +30% Q/Q to $2.3 billion
Adjusted operatng income of $391 million; 44% margin
US government revenue grew +45% Y/Y and +9% Q/Q to $373 million
Closed 139 deals of at least $1 million, 51 deals of at least $5 million, and 31 deals of at least $10 million
Revenue grew +39% Y/Y and +7% Q/Q to $884 million; +44% Y/Y and +7% Q/Q excluding Strategic Commercial Contracts

Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
