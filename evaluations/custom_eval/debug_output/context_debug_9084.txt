=== CONTEXT DEBUG FOR QUESTION ===
Question: What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?

Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar 
We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most 
troubled developed market is the United Kingdom, 
where investors seem to have become disillusioned 
with fiscal policy. In 2025, the noise surrounding the 
dollar has been greater than the observed market 
stress, despite the dramatic moves in the middle of 
April. So far in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen 
simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds 
and currencies. 
In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline.

their portfolios.

IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?

Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar

We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most

In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline.

IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
The primacy of the dollar seems durable, but at the 
margin, investors may be shifting their perceptions of 
the dollar’s value. Nearly 70% of investors surveyed 
think the dollar is “overvalued,” and a net 61%, the 
highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to 
depreciate.11 Our base case is that the dollar loses a few 
more percentage points by the end of the year against 
major currencies, with risks tilted to the downside. 
The historical precedents of sustained dollar weakness 
(1970–1980, 1985–1992 and 2002–2008) resulted in 
~40% depreciation over a 5- to 10-year period. Academic 
estimates suggest that ex-U.S. investors own ~30% of 
U.S.-issued fixed income and equity (public and private) 
securities.12 Even marginal repatriation could result 
in a significant change in relative valuations between 
U.S. and rest-of-world assets. 
Diversifying currency exposure can mitigate potential 
losses associated with dollar depreciation. We are 
focused on the euro, Japanese yen and gold due to 
their size, liquidity and historical roles as alternative 
reserve assets. Central banks, with nearly $13 trillion in 
reserves, have already increased allocations to these 
currencies, reflecting their deep, liquid markets and 
potential for preserving purchasing power. The euro 
and yen also have a lower correlation to global growth, 
which reduces cyclical exposure within a portfolio. 
Currency diversification probably comes more naturally 
to investors outside of the United States than to those 
inside the United States. The path of least resistance 
for U.S.-based investors could be exposure to equities 
denominated in the euro and yen. In fact, J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market 
Assumptions suggest that U.S. dollar depreciation will 
add 1%–2% annually to total returns for European and 
Japanese equity investments in U.S. dollar terms for the 
next 10–15 years. 
Importantly, those equity markets are also expected 
to outperform the United States on an absolute basis. 
Investing in private equity investments could also be a 
way to diversify geographic and currency exposure. U.S. 
equities make up between 70% and 75% of public equity 
benchmarks, but they account for only half of global 
buyout volumes.13 
Investors may also consider foreign currency 
denominated bonds, but they should understand the 
risks involved. A dollar-based investor in an unhedged 
ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 
2x the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio 
over the last 20 years.

Investors are skittish – and who can blame them? The 
building blocks they had taken for granted – a durable 
economic expansion, limited new barriers to global 
trade and continued spending on artificial intelligence 
(AI) – are suddenly at risk. Lofty expectations at the 
start of the year have collided with a far rougher reality. 
“Uncertainty” is the now ubiquitous word for businesses 
weighing capital investment, households pondering the 
next big purchase, central banks setting interest rate 
policy and investors making asset-allocation decisions. 
In our Mid-Year Outlook, we aim to answer five essential 
questions that could help you unlock opportunity in 
uncertainty and stay focused on your wealth plan. 
1. Should investors cheer or fear Trump 2.0? 
2. Is your portfolio resilient to growing risks? 
3. Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar? 
4. Why isn’t anyone talking about AI anymore? 
5. What’s the deal with dealmaking? 
Investors were not asking as many questions six months 
ago. Many of them initially cheered the incoming U.S. 
administration, which they believed would be pro-growth 
and investor friendly. That no longer seems a sure thing. 
The sequencing of policies has been a surprise. 
Consensus expectations envisioned pro-growth 
policies dominating the Trump administration’s 
agenda. Instead, the least market-friendly policies 
(higher tariffs, less immigration and austerity through 
Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE]– 
orchestrated government spending cuts) are taking 
effect quickly. Investors are focusing in particular on the 
administration’s chaotic tariff strategy and the potential 
for the levies to constrain growth and boost inflation. 
Meanwhile, Congress is contemplating a tax bill that 
could add nearly $6 trillion to the budget deficit over 
the next 10 years. The benefits of deregulation have 
yet to emerge. Capital markets activity remains largely 
dormant – IPO activity in both value and volume has 
been slower than in 2024 and 2023. 
The market bounty, in other words, has yet to arrive, 
and returns across assets look very different than they 
did last year.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
IS YOUR PORTFOLIO RESILIENT TO GROWING RISKS? 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We believe equity-linked structured notes can work well 
in the current environment, for investors who qualify. 
Our clients seem to agree: Twice as many are utilizing 
structured notes this year relative to 2024. 
Many equity-linked structured notes pay a coupon, 
periodically or at maturity. This coupon is a function 
of implied equity market volatility and interest rates. 
We believe both will remain elevated relative to 
recent history, potentially providing greater downside 
protection, higher potential coupons, or both. 
Equity-linked structured notes create another lever that 
qualified investors can pull to generate income that is 
not correlated to fixed income markets. Indeed, these 
equity-linked structured notes can generate higher 
return potential with a narrower range of possible 
outcomes than assets with similar volatility, such as 
preferred equities and high-yield bonds. Individual 
circumstances will differ, but investors who qualify can 
consider exploring structured notes as part of their 
portfolios, potentially starting with a modest allocation. 
Alternative assets to help strengthen portfolio resilience 
Hedge funds are another asset that can potentially 
strengthen portfolio resilience for suitable investors. 
From December 2019 to August 2024, almost 80% 
of randomly generated hedge fund composites 
outperformed a simple stock/bond mix on a risk-
adjusted basis.4 Going forward, we expect diversified 
hedge fund strategies to deliver returns and volatility 
that are slightly higher than core fixed income (as 
proxied here by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index), 
with very little correlation to it.5 
Equity and credit valuations remain elevated at a 
time of uncertainty about policy, growth and inflation 
trajectories. This will likely support sustainably higher 
levels of volatility and dispersion across and within asset 
classes. Against this backdrop, we particularly favor 
less correlated hedge funds (such as relative value 
and macro), which are designed to capitalize on the 
dislocations created during periods of market turbulence. 
Finally, hedge fund returns hold up well on an after-
tax basis for U.S. investors. Market participants often 
assume that hedge funds generate short-term gains 
that erode after-tax returns. But we have found that on 
a three-, five- and 10-year rolling basis, portfolios that 
include hedge funds have outperformed those 
that do not, even on an after-tax basis.6 
We have also focused on infrastructure investments 
to provide portfolio resilience. Here, investors benefit 
from long-term contracts that often embed inflation 
protection. Further, over 40% of the historical returns 
of infrastructure investments are driven by income. 
Generating income through infrastructure may be 
especially attractive (for suitable investors) in a world 
of elevated bond market volatility. Since the second 
quarter of 2008, infrastructure has generated total 
returns in the low double digits on an annual basis.7 
Finally, we note that a secular shift toward 
greater demand for power generation and digital 
infrastructure may create new opportunities in 
the infrastructure sector. Further, more frequent

IS YOUR PORTFOLIO RESILIENT TO GROWING RISKS?

We believe equity-linked structured notes can work well 
in the current environment, for investors who qualify. 
Our clients seem to agree: Twice as many are utilizing 
structured notes this year relative to 2024.

Many equity-linked structured notes pay a coupon, 
periodically or at maturity. This coupon is a function 
of implied equity market volatility and interest rates. 
We believe both will remain elevated relative to 
recent history, potentially providing greater downside 
protection, higher potential coupons, or both.

Equity-linked structured notes create another lever that 
qualified investors can pull to generate income that is 
not correlated to fixed income markets. Indeed, these 
equity-linked structured notes can generate higher 
return potential with a narrower range of possible 
outcomes than assets with similar volatility, such as 
preferred equities and high-yield bonds. Individual 
circumstances will differ, but investors who qualify can 
consider exploring structured notes as part of their 
portfolios, potentially starting with a modest allocation.

Alternative assets to help strengthen portfolio resilience

Hedge funds are another asset that can potentially 
strengthen portfolio resilience for suitable investors. 
From December 2019 to August 2024, almost 80% 
of randomly generated hedge fund composites 
outperformed a simple stock/bond mix on a risk-
adjusted basis.4 Going forward, we expect diversified 
hedge fund strategies to deliver returns and volatility 
that are slightly higher than core fixed income (as 
proxied here by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index), 
with very little correlation to it.5

Equity and credit valuations remain elevated at a 
time of uncertainty about policy, growth and inflation 
trajectories. This will likely support sustainably higher 
levels of volatility and dispersion across and within asset 
classes. Against this backdrop, we particularly favor 
less correlated hedge funds (such as relative value 
and macro), which are designed to capitalize on the 
dislocations created during periods of market turbulence.

Finally, hedge fund returns hold up well on an after-
tax basis for U.S. investors. Market participants often 
assume that hedge funds generate short-term gains

that erode after-tax returns. But we have found that on 
a three-, five- and 10-year rolling basis, portfolios that 
include hedge funds have outperformed those 
that do not, even on an after-tax basis.6

We have also focused on infrastructure investments 
to provide portfolio resilience. Here, investors benefit 
from long-term contracts that often embed inflation 
protection. Further, over 40% of the historical returns 
of infrastructure investments are driven by income. 
Generating income through infrastructure may be 
especially attractive (for suitable investors) in a world 
of elevated bond market volatility. Since the second 
quarter of 2008, infrastructure has generated total 
returns in the low double digits on an annual basis.7

Finally, we note that a secular shift toward 
greater demand for power generation and digital 
infrastructure may create new opportunities in 
the infrastructure sector. Further, more frequent 
and severe climate and weather shocks reinforce the 
growing demand for resilient infrastructure.

Investors are weighing dissonant risks to growth and inflation. Higher barriers to trade could raise prices, 
slow growth and hurt equity valuations. On the other hand, stimulative fiscal policy from the United States, 
China and Europe could place upward pressure on bond yields. It is difficult to predict the net impact of all 
these factors. But our analysis suggests that if the final Congressional legislation matches Senate instructions 
and dollar weakness continues, inflation could move higher over the next year.

1) We assume the fiscal reconciliation package passed this year meets the maximum cumulative deficit impact ($5.8 trillion) as outlined by the Senate’s budget resolution 
instructions. 2) We assume a 2% hit to real GDP from the tariffs announced year-to-date, which results in the unemployment rate rising just under 1%. 3) We assume a 
-10% depreciation in the broad real effective U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
Whether inflation, growth or markets move up, down or 
sideways, portfolio resilience – a key theme of our 2025 
outlook – can help clients reach their wealth goals. 
Before we get into the specifics of portfolio resilience, 
let’s step back and consider a longer-term perspective. 
In the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era (roughly 
2009–2020), portfolios gravitated to assets, primarily 
U.S. equities, which worked well in an environment 
of low inflation, low interest rates and modest 
volatility. Today, investors face two-way risks to 
growth and inflation, and what looks to be persistent 
policy uncertainty. It’s a regime shift, with important 
implications for building resilient portfolios. 
How do we think about portfolio resilience in the 
current environment? In our view, a resilient portfolio 
includes assets with low or negative correlations to each 
other, each with an intrinsic ability to outperform cash. 
Collectively, the assets offer the potential to mitigate the 
severity of portfolio-level drawdowns. Of course, core 
fixed income remains the primary source of portfolio 
resilience in a growth downturn. Opportunistic credit 
strategies could capitalize in periods of economic stress. 
Here, we discuss four attractive asset choices that 
could help make portfolios more resilient against the 
countervailing risks: equity-linked structured notes, 
hedge funds, infrastructure and gold.
