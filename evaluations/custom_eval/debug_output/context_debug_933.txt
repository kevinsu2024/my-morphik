purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted operatng income and adjusted operatng margin excludes stock-based compensaton expense and related employer payroll taxes. Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potental lifetme value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the tme of 
contract executon and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reportng period. Except as noted below, TCV and RDV each presume the exercise of all contract optons available to our customers and no terminaton of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are 
subject to terminaton provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract optons will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some porton of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ ﬁnancial 
conditon, including the consideraton of such customers’ ability and intenton to pay, and whether such contracts contnue to meet the criteria for revenue recogniton, among other factors.
