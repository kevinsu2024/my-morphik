Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.
On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we
initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the
new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable
to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the
interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that
receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.

Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.

On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we
initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the
new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable
to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the
interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that
receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have
impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
Revenue was $44.1 billion, up 69% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially.
Data Center revenue was $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand
for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We saw our
Blackwell architecture ramp expand to all customer categories, while large cloud service providers remained our largest at just under 50% of Data Center
revenue. Data Center compute revenue was $34.2 billion, up 76% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Networking revenue was $5.0 billion, up 56% from a
year ago and up 64% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric in our GB200 systems and continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at
cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.
Gaming revenue was up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture.
Professional Visualization revenue was up 19% from a year ago and flat sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by broader adoption of Ada RTX
workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.
Automotive revenue was up 72% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.
Gross margin decreased from a year ago and sequentially, primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations
and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Operating expenses were up 44% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits
expenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and compute, infrastructure and engineering development costs for new product introductions.
The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth.

The increase in interest income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and debt securities.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other income (expense), net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity securities, publicly-held equity
securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other income (expense), net, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025,
was primarily driven by unrealized losses in our publicly-held equity securities due to fair value volatility in our investments, particularly CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional
information regarding our investments in non-marketable equity securities and publicly-held equity securities.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income
before income tax was an expense of 14.3% and 13.9% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-
derived intangible income deduction.
Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the
near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could
vary based on our assessment of all available information.
