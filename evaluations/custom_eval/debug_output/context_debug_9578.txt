Q1 2025 Highlights
The term “Strategic Commercial Contracts” is as deﬁned in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ﬁled on February 18, 2025. Rule of 40 refers to the sum of our revenue growth rate year-over-year and our adjusted operatng margin. The value of deals closed reﬂects the total contract value of contracts that have been entered 
into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers and includes existng contractual obligatons and unexercised contract optons available to those customers. Adjusted free cash ﬂow and adjusted free cash ﬂow margin exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensaton and 
purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted operatng income and adjusted operatng margin excludes stock-based compensaton expense and related employer payroll taxes. Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potental lifetme value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the tme of 
contract executon and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reportng period. Except as noted below, TCV and RDV each presume the exercise of all contract optons available to our customers and no terminaton of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are 
subject to terminaton provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract optons will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some porton of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ ﬁnancial 
conditon, including the consideraton of such customers’ ability and intenton to pay, and whether such contracts contnue to meet the criteria for revenue recogniton, among other factors. Adjusted EPS excludes stock-based compensaton expense, related employer payroll taxes, and income tax eﬀects and adjustments. 
Please see the appendix for reconciliatons of these and other non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
US commercial revenue grew +71% Y/Y and +19% Q/Q to $255 million
US revenue grew +55% Y/Y and +13% Q/Q to $628 million

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
SHOULD INVESTORS CHEER OR FEAR TRUMP 2.0?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Will deregulation make a difference in the real economy? 
While Congressional legislation will likely be a 
challenge, deregulation is quietly delivering a positive 
impact on the banking sector. We think investors may 
underestimate its benefits. 
Currently, large U.S. banks have built more than $200 
billion of excess capital over current requirements. 
Now that capital rules are likely to be softened, this 
excess is likely to be deployed across three channels: 
private sector loan growth, share buybacks and 
banking sector consolidation. 
The first channel, private sector loan growth, is a priority 
of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Before the 
tariff shock, commercial and industrial loan demand was 
inflecting higher, and the Trump administration would 
like to accelerate the pace. On the buyback front, in Q1, 
Goldman Sachs announced a share repurchase plan 
worth 26% of its market capitalization. 
Additionally, we expect that cost synergies, the benefits 
of scaling up compliance technology demands and 
geographic diversification will spur further banking 
sector consolidation. U.S. regulators recently approved 
Capital One’s purchase of Discover, which could bode 
well for bank M&A activity. 
Bank stocks should benefit over the medium term, and 
existing preferred equity could be supported by less 
supply going forward. Indeed, if the Trump administration 
begins to focus on the pro-growth aspects of its agenda in 
the second half of 2025, bank stocks may be among the 
high-profile beneficiaries.
