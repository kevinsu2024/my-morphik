We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity
and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.
We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin
shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased
inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.
The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly
important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our
competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services.
Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large
language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.
The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.
In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a
worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z
ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200
and GB200. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements
of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that
could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to
do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt
supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.
Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.

more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying
component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if
our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. Our ability to increase
manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume timely. Delays or
shortfalls could impact our ability to meet demand.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support
new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive
products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of
AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions
each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Qualification
time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product
introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation
architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future
architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as
planned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that
could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter
of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be
able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.
Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able
to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any
reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
The use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our products, including by leading to
inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum.
It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of
cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in
cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain
transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate
demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and
may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs,
which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may
be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete
with our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our
revenue.
We are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product
regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.
Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive,
