complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand
between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to
dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from
judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel
affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in
dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to
reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay
the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter.
NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of
certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued
judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the
case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

We have provided indemnities for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our
technology-related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a
maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.


Litigation


Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits


The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended

(2)    Revenue recognized includes $6.0 billion and $123 million related to customer advances for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
We recognized revenue of $265 million and $188 million in the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively, that were included in the prior year end
deferred revenue balance.
As of April  27, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8  billion, which includes
$1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue. Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts
greater than one year in length will be recognized over the next twelve months.
Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign
currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. During the first quarter of
fiscal years 2026 and 2025, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not
significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign
currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of April 27, 2025 and January 26, 2025.
As of April 27, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months were not significant.

centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere. Over 99% of controlled Data Center compute revenue billed to Singapore was
for orders from U.S.-based customers. Controlled Data Center compute refers to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet the
characteristics of Export Control Classification Numbers 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200,
GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service providers, or CSPs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 14% of total
revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two direct customers
represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

Note 4 - Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income
before income tax was an expense of 14.3% and 13.9% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-
derived intangible income deduction.
Our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from
the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S.
federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.
Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the
near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could
vary based on our assessment of all available information.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position
will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal,
state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise
resolved with the respective tax authorities.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of April  27, 2025, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information
we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing a phased upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or
ERP, system to update our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating
results. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.
Part II. Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 11  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 26, 2025. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or
reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are
immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Long manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and capacity availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately, has
led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting
the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,
provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue.
We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.
If we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply
commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both
product shortages and excess inventory, significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and
contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased

Text Content:
Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
The primacy of the dollar seems durable, but at the 
margin, investors may be shifting their perceptions of 
the dollar’s value. Nearly 70% of investors surveyed 
think the dollar is “overvalued,” and a net 61%, the 
highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to 
depreciate.11 Our base case is that the dollar loses a few 
more percentage points by the end of the year against 
major currencies, with risks tilted to the downside. 
The historical precedents of sustained dollar weakness 
(1970–1980, 1985–1992 and 2002–2008) resulted in 
~40% depreciation over a 5- to 10-year period. Academic 
estimates suggest that ex-U.S. investors own ~30% of 
U.S.-issued fixed income and equity (public and private) 
securities.12 Even marginal repatriation could result 
in a significant change in relative valuations between 
U.S. and rest-of-world assets. 
Diversifying currency exposure can mitigate potential 
losses associated with dollar depreciation. We are 
focused on the euro, Japanese yen and gold due to 
their size, liquidity and historical roles as alternative 
reserve assets. Central banks, with nearly $13 trillion in 
reserves, have already increased allocations to these 
currencies, reflecting their deep, liquid markets and 
potential for preserving purchasing power. The euro 
and yen also have a lower correlation to global growth, 
which reduces cyclical exposure within a portfolio. 
Currency diversification probably comes more naturally 
to investors outside of the United States than to those 
inside the United States. The path of least resistance 
for U.S.-based investors could be exposure to equities 
denominated in the euro and yen. In fact, J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market 
Assumptions suggest that U.S. dollar depreciation will 
add 1%–2% annually to total returns for European and 
Japanese equity investments in U.S. dollar terms for the 
next 10–15 years. 
Importantly, those equity markets are also expected 
to outperform the United States on an absolute basis. 
Investing in private equity investments could also be a 
way to diversify geographic and currency exposure. U.S. 
equities make up between 70% and 75% of public equity 
benchmarks, but they account for only half of global 
buyout volumes.13 
Investors may also consider foreign currency 
denominated bonds, but they should understand the 
risks involved. A dollar-based investor in an unhedged 
ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 
2x the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio 
over the last 20 years.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January  26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of
results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
In June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Fiscal Year
Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The first quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week
quarters.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,
investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other
charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of
information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing the
effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the year ending January 25, 2026.
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,
including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within
each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Investors are weighing dissonant risks to growth and inflation. Higher barriers to trade could raise prices, 
slow growth and hurt equity valuations. On the other hand, stimulative fiscal policy from the United States, 
China and Europe could place upward pressure on bond yields. It is difficult to predict the net impact of all 
these factors. But our analysis suggests that if the final Congressional legislation matches Senate instructions 
and dollar weakness continues, inflation could move higher over the next year.

Note: This chart utilizes the Fed’s FRB/U.S. macro econometric model to assess the inflationary impact from several key vectors, including forward-looking assumptions. 
1) We assume the fiscal reconciliation package passed this year meets the maximum cumulative deficit impact ($5.8 trillion) as outlined by the Senate’s budget resolution 
instructions. 2) We assume a 2% hit to real GDP from the tariffs announced year-to-date, which results in the unemployment rate rising just under 1%. 3) We assume a 
-10% depreciation in the broad real effective U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
Whether inflation, growth or markets move up, down or 
sideways, portfolio resilience – a key theme of our 2025 
outlook – can help clients reach their wealth goals. 
Before we get into the specifics of portfolio resilience, 
let’s step back and consider a longer-term perspective. 
In the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era (roughly 
2009–2020), portfolios gravitated to assets, primarily 
U.S. equities, which worked well in an environment 
of low inflation, low interest rates and modest 
volatility. Today, investors face two-way risks to 
growth and inflation, and what looks to be persistent 
policy uncertainty. It’s a regime shift, with important 
implications for building resilient portfolios. 
How do we think about portfolio resilience in the 
current environment? In our view, a resilient portfolio 
includes assets with low or negative correlations to each 
other, each with an intrinsic ability to outperform cash. 
Collectively, the assets offer the potential to mitigate the 
severity of portfolio-level drawdowns. Of course, core 
fixed income remains the primary source of portfolio 
resilience in a growth downturn. Opportunistic credit 
strategies could capitalize in periods of economic stress. 
Here, we discuss four attractive asset choices that 
could help make portfolios more resilient against the 
countervailing risks: equity-linked structured notes, 
hedge funds, infrastructure and gold.

Q1 2025 Highlights
The term “Strategic Commercial Contracts” is as deﬁned in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ﬁled on February 18, 2025. Rule of 40 refers to the sum of our revenue growth rate year-over-year and our adjusted operatng margin. The value of deals closed reﬂects the total contract value of contracts that have been entered 
into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers and includes existng contractual obligatons and unexercised contract optons available to those customers. Adjusted free cash ﬂow and adjusted free cash ﬂow margin exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensaton and 
purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted operatng income and adjusted operatng margin excludes stock-based compensaton expense and related employer payroll taxes. Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potental lifetme value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the tme of 
contract executon and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reportng period. Except as noted below, TCV and RDV each presume the exercise of all contract optons available to our customers and no terminaton of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are 
subject to terminaton provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract optons will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some porton of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ ﬁnancial 
conditon, including the consideraton of such customers’ ability and intenton to pay, and whether such contracts contnue to meet the criteria for revenue recogniton, among other factors. Adjusted EPS excludes stock-based compensaton expense, related employer payroll taxes, and income tax eﬀects and adjustments. 
Please see the appendix for reconciliatons of these and other non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Unaudited)
The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed
January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once
the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,
purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and
violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and
improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et
al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition for writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties
discuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. On March 7, 2025, the district court adopted the parties' stipulation to
extend the stay until the final and complete resolution of the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on
behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information,
corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements
related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including
disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.
Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.
2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and
insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on
GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of
unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation
action.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of April 27, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while
reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged
in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the
ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.
Note 12 - Shareholders’ Equity 
Capital Return Program 
We repurchased 126 million and 99 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion and $8.0 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A.
“Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.
Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.
On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we
initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the
new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable
to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the
interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that
receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale,
resulting in excess inventory and purchase obligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in
foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
The increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek to
strictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with
partners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations may
negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.
In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United
States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also
considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.
Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.
Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage
customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing
components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing
certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new
standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the
Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,
this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results
and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our
business and financial results.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We repurchased 126 million and 99 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion and $8.0 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase
agreements in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. Our share
repurchase program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR 
INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 
OF INTEREST 
Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. or any of its affiliates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual 
or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of 
our clients’ portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. 
Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following 
activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan 
invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, 
structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund 
issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, 
such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. 
Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and 
trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives 
payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a 
client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for 
providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping 
or custody) with respect to investment products purchased 
for a client’s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of 
relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. 
Morgan acts for its own account. 
Investment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan 
and third-party asset managers and are subject to a 
review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of 
strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies 
we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views 
in order to meet the portfolio’s investment objective. 
As a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. 
We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies 
will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for 
example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable 
law and any account-specific considerations. 
While our internally managed strategies generally align well with 
our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment
