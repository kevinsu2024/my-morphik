Q1 2025 Highlights
The term “Strategic Commercial Contracts” is as deﬁned in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ﬁled on February 18, 2025. Rule of 40 refers to the sum of our revenue growth rate year-over-year and our adjusted operatng margin. The value of deals closed reﬂects the total contract value of contracts that have been entered 
into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers and includes existng contractual obligatons and unexercised contract optons available to those customers. Adjusted free cash ﬂow and adjusted free cash ﬂow margin exclude employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensaton and 
purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted operatng income and adjusted operatng margin excludes stock-based compensaton expense and related employer payroll taxes. Total contract value (“TCV”) is the total potental lifetme value of contracts entered into with, or awarded by, our customers at the tme of 
contract executon and remaining deal value (“RDV”) is the total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reportng period. Except as noted below, TCV and RDV each presume the exercise of all contract optons available to our customers and no terminaton of contracts. However, the majority of our contracts are 
subject to terminaton provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract optons will be exercised. Further, RDV may exclude all or some porton of the value of certain commercial contracts as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ ﬁnancial 
conditon, including the consideraton of such customers’ ability and intenton to pay, and whether such contracts contnue to meet the criteria for revenue recogniton, among other factors. Adjusted EPS excludes stock-based compensaton expense, related employer payroll taxes, and income tax eﬀects and adjustments. 
Please see the appendix for reconciliatons of these and other non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

(2)    Revenue recognized includes $6.0 billion and $123 million related to customer advances for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
We recognized revenue of $265 million and $188 million in the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively, that were included in the prior year end
deferred revenue balance.
As of April  27, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8  billion, which includes
$1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue. Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts
greater than one year in length will be recognized over the next twelve months.
Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign
currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. During the first quarter of
fiscal years 2026 and 2025, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not
significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign
currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.

As of April 27, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months were not significant.

Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
SHOULD INVESTORS CHEER OR FEAR TRUMP 2.0?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Will deregulation make a difference in the real economy? 
While Congressional legislation will likely be a 
challenge, deregulation is quietly delivering a positive 
impact on the banking sector. We think investors may 
underestimate its benefits. 
Currently, large U.S. banks have built more than $200 
billion of excess capital over current requirements. 
Now that capital rules are likely to be softened, this 
excess is likely to be deployed across three channels: 
private sector loan growth, share buybacks and 
banking sector consolidation. 
The first channel, private sector loan growth, is a priority 
of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Before the 
tariff shock, commercial and industrial loan demand was 
inflecting higher, and the Trump administration would 
like to accelerate the pace. On the buyback front, in Q1, 
Goldman Sachs announced a share repurchase plan 
worth 26% of its market capitalization. 
Additionally, we expect that cost synergies, the benefits 
of scaling up compliance technology demands and 
geographic diversification will spur further banking 
sector consolidation. U.S. regulators recently approved 
Capital One’s purchase of Discover, which could bode 
well for bank M&A activity. 
Bank stocks should benefit over the medium term, and 
existing preferred equity could be supported by less 
supply going forward. Indeed, if the Trump administration 
begins to focus on the pro-growth aspects of its agenda in 
the second half of 2025, bank stocks may be among the 
high-profile beneficiaries.

centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere. Over 99% of controlled Data Center compute revenue billed to Singapore was
for orders from U.S.-based customers. Controlled Data Center compute refers to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet the
characteristics of Export Control Classification Numbers 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200,
GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include cloud
service providers, or CSPs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 14% of total
revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two direct customers
represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
 
 
 
 
 
 
Foreword 
The markets are far from certain and investors are facing the challenges that 
come with that. As we approach the midpoint of the year, the turbulence 
remains stubbornly unpredictable – even to those of us who’ve seen markets 
rise and fall plenty of times. 
In our Mid-Year Outlook, we will answer five key questions that can help you 
make progress toward your financial goals. It’s a timely report and we hope you 
find it useful. 
Our Global Investment Strategy Group sees the global economy losing some 
steam in the short run, as recession risks have picked up. In the long run, they 
believe the economy will weather the headwinds and absorb higher tariffs, 
thanks in part to growth-friendly policies. Of course, it’s hard to predict exactly 
how U.S. policy will evolve. Look for that to play a major role in shaping 
markets worldwide. 
Now is a great time to consider solutions that can help keep your portfolio 
resilient. Our end goal is to build strong, thoughtfully designed portfolios that 
not only align with our core view and your goals, but can also withstand periods 
of volatility. 
Whatever markets have in store, we are here to stand by your side. It’s a 
privilege to be your financial partner in good times and bad. Thank you for your 
continued trust and confidence in J.P. Morgan Wealth Management.
