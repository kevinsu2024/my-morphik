Foreword 
The markets are far from certain and investors are facing the challenges that 
come with that. As we approach the midpoint of the year, the turbulence 
remains stubbornly unpredictable – even to those of us who’ve seen markets 
rise and fall plenty of times. 
In our Mid-Year Outlook, we will answer five key questions that can help you 
make progress toward your financial goals. It’s a timely report and we hope you 
find it useful. 
Our Global Investment Strategy Group sees the global economy losing some 
steam in the short run, as recession risks have picked up. In the long run, they 
believe the economy will weather the headwinds and absorb higher tariffs, 
thanks in part to growth-friendly policies. Of course, it’s hard to predict exactly 
how U.S. policy will evolve. Look for that to play a major role in shaping 
markets worldwide. 
Now is a great time to consider solutions that can help keep your portfolio 
resilient. Our end goal is to build strong, thoughtfully designed portfolios that 
not only align with our core view and your goals, but can also withstand periods 
of volatility. 
Whatever markets have in store, we are here to stand by your side. It’s a 
privilege to be your financial partner in good times and bad. Thank you for your 
continued trust and confidence in J.P. Morgan Wealth Management.

Investors are skittish – and who can blame them? The 
building blocks they had taken for granted – a durable 
economic expansion, limited new barriers to global 
trade and continued spending on artificial intelligence 
(AI) – are suddenly at risk. Lofty expectations at the 
start of the year have collided with a far rougher reality. 
“Uncertainty” is the now ubiquitous word for businesses 
weighing capital investment, households pondering the 
next big purchase, central banks setting interest rate 
policy and investors making asset-allocation decisions. 
In our Mid-Year Outlook, we aim to answer five essential 
questions that could help you unlock opportunity in 
uncertainty and stay focused on your wealth plan. 
1. Should investors cheer or fear Trump 2.0? 
2. Is your portfolio resilient to growing risks? 
3. Is this the downfall of the U.S. dollar? 
4. Why isn’t anyone talking about AI anymore? 
5. What’s the deal with dealmaking? 
Investors were not asking as many questions six months 
ago. Many of them initially cheered the incoming U.S. 
administration, which they believed would be pro-growth 
and investor friendly. That no longer seems a sure thing. 
The sequencing of policies has been a surprise. 
Consensus expectations envisioned pro-growth 
policies dominating the Trump administration’s 
agenda. Instead, the least market-friendly policies 
(higher tariffs, less immigration and austerity through 
Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE]– 
orchestrated government spending cuts) are taking 
effect quickly. Investors are focusing in particular on the 
administration’s chaotic tariff strategy and the potential 
for the levies to constrain growth and boost inflation. 
Meanwhile, Congress is contemplating a tax bill that 
could add nearly $6 trillion to the budget deficit over 
the next 10 years. The benefits of deregulation have 
yet to emerge. Capital markets activity remains largely 
dormant – IPO activity in both value and volume has 
been slower than in 2024 and 2023. 
The market bounty, in other words, has yet to arrive, 
and returns across assets look very different than they 
did last year.

Where do we go from here? 
Economic fundamentals appear solid for now, although 
we do expect the global economy to soften in the 
short term due to tariff policy. Of course, recession 
risks are higher than they were at the beginning of 
the year. In that context, we note that central banks, 
especially outside the United States, maintain an easing 
bias and could lower rates more aggressively to offset 
the damage from a sharp drop in global trade and 
consumption. That said, we seem to have passed the 
peak of tariff-related uncertainty; higher duties will likely 
slow growth but not stop it. 
Investors must contend with policy uncertainty, still-
elevated valuations and concentration in U.S. equity 
markets, and persistent volatility. Stable fundamentals 
today, deep uncertainty about tomorrow – the 
disconnect is unavoidable. 
Given that reality, can you invest new money in global 
equity markets now? 
It’s a difficult question, but we think the answer is yes. 
We believe it is more likely than not that U.S. as well 
as European and Japanese equity markets will make 
new highs over the next 12 months. Investors may be 
underestimating technology sector earnings and the 
impact of deregulation on bank lending.  
Looking beyond equities to the broader investment 
landscape, we think investors should consider 
strategies that capitalize on uncertainty and ensure 
that portfolios are resilient enough to meet their 
wealth goals under what is now a wider range of 
economic and market outcomes, both positive and 
negative. While portfolio resilience often focuses on 
potential downside risks, we also need to acknowledge 
the potential for upside opportunities. 
Finally, given the balance of risks, and the likelihood of 
a downtrend for the U.S. dollar, a resilient and globally 
diversified portfolio can help give you the confidence 
you need to stick with your long-term plan. It’s time to 
get comfortable being uncomfortable.

2025 MID-YEAR OUTLOOK
SHOULD INVESTORS CHEER OR FEAR TRUMP 2.0?
 
 
 
As we’ve said – and as investors well know – the pain 
of Trump 2.0 arrived early for markets. U.S. policy 
uncertainty has spiked, and business and household 
confidence has collapsed, largely due to on-again, off-
again announcements around tariff policy. Meanwhile, 
the expected market benefits of Trump 2.0 – increased 
M&A and capital market activity, additional corporate 
tax cuts and extensive deregulation – have so far failed 
to materialize. 
No one can predict the ultimate size, scope or duration 
of future tariffs, by the United States or its trading 
partners. But their general outlines clearly signal an 
abrupt and chaotic reversal of the post–World War 
II trend toward free trade. Of all the administration’s 
policies, tariffs spark the greatest investor unease. That’s 
because higher tariffs, all else equal, lead to slower 
growth, higher prices and lower corporate profits. 
Our latest thinking suggests that the U.S. effective tariff 
rate (after deals, exclusions and substitution effects are 
accounted for) will settle in the mid-teens. That would 
be the highest levels since the Smoot-Hawley era of the 
early 1930s. Despite tariffs, we believe the U.S. economy 
can manage slightly positive growth, with corporate 
earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits over 
the next 12 months. Tariff rates that remained at their 
initial “Liberation Day” levels (the April 2 introduction of 
new U.S. tariffs) would be enough to knock the U.S. and 
likely global economies into recession this year.

“Liberation Day” tariff rate is as of April 2, and does not include exclusions or substitution effects. The estimated tariff range assumes a universal increase in the tariff 
rate of 10% and announced exclusions with +/-5% to account for uncertainty. Non-Liberation Day tariffs include +25% global autos; +20% on China; +25% on Canada and 
Mexico non-USMCA;  +25% on steel and aluminum.

rate (after deals, exclusions and substitution effects are 
accounted for) will settle in the mid-teens. That would 
be the highest levels since the Smoot-Hawley era of the 
early 1930s. Despite tariffs, we believe the U.S. economy 
can manage slightly positive growth, with corporate 
earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits over 
the next 12 months. Tariff rates that remained at their 
initial “Liberation Day” levels (the April 2 introduction of 
new U.S. tariffs) would be enough to knock the U.S. and 
likely global economies into recession this year.

“Liberation Day” tariff rate is as of April 2, and does not include exclusions or substitution effects. The estimated tariff range assumes a universal increase in the tariff 
rate of 10% and announced exclusions with +/-5% to account for uncertainty. Non-Liberation Day tariffs include +25% global autos; +20% on China; +25% on Canada and 
Mexico non-USMCA;  +25% on steel and aluminum.

During Trump’s 2018 trade war, companies raised prices, 
shifted supply chains and emphasized higher-margin 
products to protect their profits. But that approach 
will be much tougher in 2025. Today’s proposed U.S. 
tariffs are nearly four times larger than the 2018 duties 
when measured as a share of GDP. In fact, the tariffs 
announced represent one of the largest tax hikes outside 
of wartime in U.S. history.1 
The global nature of this trade war increases the 
downside risks. When the United States starts a trade war 
with an individual trading partner, it enjoys a clear size 
advantage. For example, Canadian exports to the United 
States make up 20% of the Canadian economy, but U.S. 
exports to Canada account for just 1.2% of a much bigger 
U.S. economy. Yet U.S. exports to the rest of the world are 
7% of U.S. GDP, while rest-of-world exports to the United 
States are just 4% of rest-of-world GDP. 
This shift in trade war vulnerability could be 
one important reason why non-U.S. assets have 
outperformed U.S. assets so far this year. 
Another reason? In Europe, amid a frayed transatlantic 
alliance, many countries are moving to further boost 
their defenses and spending to ensure their own 
security. Regional industrial policy is creating secular 
investment opportunities for multiple megatrends, from 
electrification to the reshoring of manufacturing. For 
example, the German government has turned its back on 
decades of fiscal restraint to finance spending on defense 
and infrastructure. We think it has the potential to boost 
annual Eurozone growth from a paltry 0.5% pace in 2025 
to over 1% in 2026.

A market turning point from tax cuts? 
Republicans in Congress are attempting to coalesce 
around a plan to amend and extend the 2017 Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act. The latest set of Senate instructions for the 
budget reconciliation process, which allows lawmakers 
to pass tax and spending legislation by a mere majority 
in the House and Senate, provides for a nearly $6 trillion 
cumulative increase in the budget deficit over the 
next 10 years. That increase would be larger than that 
created by the original Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CARES 
Act, the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act combined. 
Equity investors may exhale, given that the bill may net 
~$100 billion–$200 billion per year in new annual fiscal 
support, even as most of the costs come from extending 
current tax policy. Fixed income investors may have a 
different perspective. With longer-term bond yields near 
cycle highs, investors are assessing the compensation 
needed to finance this proposed borrowing binge. 
Congress could agree to more spending cuts, which 
could support bond markets. But that is no sure thing, 
in large part because most cuts would likely come from 
Medicaid. Previous attempts to cut Medicaid benefits 
(most notably the Graham-Cassidy Bill of 2017) faced stiff 
political resistance. Rolling back portions of the Inflation 
Reduction Act (e.g., tax credits for electric vehicles) could 
help to offset some of the costs of the tax cuts. Even 
accounting for these potential spending cuts, the deficit 
seems set to grow – the only question is how much.

Will deregulation make a difference in the real economy? 
While Congressional legislation will likely be a 
challenge, deregulation is quietly delivering a positive 
impact on the banking sector. We think investors may 
underestimate its benefits. 
Currently, large U.S. banks have built more than $200 
billion of excess capital over current requirements. 
Now that capital rules are likely to be softened, this 
excess is likely to be deployed across three channels: 
private sector loan growth, share buybacks and 
banking sector consolidation. 
The first channel, private sector loan growth, is a priority 
of U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Before the 
tariff shock, commercial and industrial loan demand was 
inflecting higher, and the Trump administration would 
like to accelerate the pace. On the buyback front, in Q1, 
Goldman Sachs announced a share repurchase plan 
worth 26% of its market capitalization. 
Additionally, we expect that cost synergies, the benefits 
of scaling up compliance technology demands and 
geographic diversification will spur further banking 
sector consolidation. U.S. regulators recently approved 
Capital One’s purchase of Discover, which could bode 
well for bank M&A activity. 
Bank stocks should benefit over the medium term, and 
existing preferred equity could be supported by less 
supply going forward. Indeed, if the Trump administration 
begins to focus on the pro-growth aspects of its agenda in 
the second half of 2025, bank stocks may be among the 
high-profile beneficiaries.

Will tech stocks get 
a second wind? 
Tech and tech-adjacent stocks have an outsized 
influence on U.S. equity market performance. As of 
May 9, the technology sector is down over 8%, and the 
Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks have fallen over 12% year­
to-date. 
But tech stocks could get a second wind: Company 
earnings are strong, and valuations are not excessive. 
What’s more, we’re big believers in the long-term 
potential of AI, as we explore in a later section. 
The Magnificent 7 is expected to deliver 15% EPS growth 
in 2025 versus 8% EPS growth for the rest of the market. 
So far this year, the tech stars have underperformed 
the rest of the S&P 500, as investors worried that the 
companies’ capex plans might be too aggressive. 
On the valuation front, the Mag 7 stocks do not appear 
cheap, at a 26x forward price-to-earnings multiple 
(versus 20x for the broad market). But valuations 
relative to the rest of the market are at their lowest 
levels of the last 10 years. Another positive signal is the 
Trump Administration’s decision to exempt, for now, 
semiconductors and other electronic products from 
tariffs. Indeed, the United States enjoys a tremendous 
comparative advantage in technological innovation. 
Eroding that strength by raising the cost of tech inputs 
would be misguided, in our view. 
To return to our opening question: Should investors 
cheer or fear Trump 2.0? Tariff policy and the 
uncertainty it generates will pressure economic growth 
and corporate profits for the better part of the coming 
year, we believe. But that may not stop a bull market. 
The administration’s more investor-friendly proposals 
(including lower interest rates, lower energy prices and 
less regulation) may well materialize in the second half 
of 2025. 
Investors should get comfortable with uncertainty and 
volatility. Choppy markets may last for a while, but 
key developed market equity markets (United States, 
Europe, Japan) should make new highs by the middle 
of next year. After all, equity markets love to climb the 
proverbial “wall of worry.”

Investors are weighing dissonant risks to growth and inflation. Higher barriers to trade could raise prices, 
slow growth and hurt equity valuations. On the other hand, stimulative fiscal policy from the United States, 
China and Europe could place upward pressure on bond yields. It is difficult to predict the net impact of all 
these factors. But our analysis suggests that if the final Congressional legislation matches Senate instructions 
and dollar weakness continues, inflation could move higher over the next year.

1) We assume the fiscal reconciliation package passed this year meets the maximum cumulative deficit impact ($5.8 trillion) as outlined by the Senate’s budget resolution 
instructions. 2) We assume a 2% hit to real GDP from the tariffs announced year-to-date, which results in the unemployment rate rising just under 1%. 3) We assume a 
-10% depreciation in the broad real effective U.S. dollar exchange rate. 
Whether inflation, growth or markets move up, down or 
sideways, portfolio resilience – a key theme of our 2025 
outlook – can help clients reach their wealth goals. 
Before we get into the specifics of portfolio resilience, 
let’s step back and consider a longer-term perspective. 
In the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) era (roughly 
2009–2020), portfolios gravitated to assets, primarily 
U.S. equities, which worked well in an environment 
of low inflation, low interest rates and modest 
volatility. Today, investors face two-way risks to 
growth and inflation, and what looks to be persistent 
policy uncertainty. It’s a regime shift, with important 
implications for building resilient portfolios. 
How do we think about portfolio resilience in the 
current environment? In our view, a resilient portfolio 
includes assets with low or negative correlations to each 
other, each with an intrinsic ability to outperform cash. 
Collectively, the assets offer the potential to mitigate the 
severity of portfolio-level drawdowns. Of course, core 
fixed income remains the primary source of portfolio 
resilience in a growth downturn. Opportunistic credit 
strategies could capitalize in periods of economic stress. 
Here, we discuss four attractive asset choices that 
could help make portfolios more resilient against the 
countervailing risks: equity-linked structured notes, 
hedge funds, infrastructure and gold.

We believe equity-linked structured notes can work well 
in the current environment, for investors who qualify. 
Our clients seem to agree: Twice as many are utilizing 
structured notes this year relative to 2024. 
Many equity-linked structured notes pay a coupon, 
periodically or at maturity. This coupon is a function 
of implied equity market volatility and interest rates. 
We believe both will remain elevated relative to 
recent history, potentially providing greater downside 
protection, higher potential coupons, or both. 
Equity-linked structured notes create another lever that 
qualified investors can pull to generate income that is 
not correlated to fixed income markets. Indeed, these 
equity-linked structured notes can generate higher 
return potential with a narrower range of possible 
outcomes than assets with similar volatility, such as 
preferred equities and high-yield bonds. Individual 
circumstances will differ, but investors who qualify can 
consider exploring structured notes as part of their 
portfolios, potentially starting with a modest allocation. 
Alternative assets to help strengthen portfolio resilience 
Hedge funds are another asset that can potentially 
strengthen portfolio resilience for suitable investors. 
From December 2019 to August 2024, almost 80% 
of randomly generated hedge fund composites 
outperformed a simple stock/bond mix on a risk-
adjusted basis.4 Going forward, we expect diversified 
hedge fund strategies to deliver returns and volatility 
that are slightly higher than core fixed income (as 
proxied here by the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index), 
with very little correlation to it.5 
Equity and credit valuations remain elevated at a 
time of uncertainty about policy, growth and inflation 
trajectories. This will likely support sustainably higher 
levels of volatility and dispersion across and within asset 
classes. Against this backdrop, we particularly favor 
less correlated hedge funds (such as relative value 
and macro), which are designed to capitalize on the 
dislocations created during periods of market turbulence. 
Finally, hedge fund returns hold up well on an after-
tax basis for U.S. investors. Market participants often 
assume that hedge funds generate short-term gains 
that erode after-tax returns. But we have found that on 
a three-, five- and 10-year rolling basis, portfolios that 
include hedge funds have outperformed those 
that do not, even on an after-tax basis.6 
We have also focused on infrastructure investments 
to provide portfolio resilience. Here, investors benefit 
from long-term contracts that often embed inflation 
protection. Further, over 40% of the historical returns 
of infrastructure investments are driven by income. 
Generating income through infrastructure may be 
especially attractive (for suitable investors) in a world 
of elevated bond market volatility. Since the second 
quarter of 2008, infrastructure has generated total 
returns in the low double digits on an annual basis.7 
Finally, we note that a secular shift toward 
greater demand for power generation and digital 
infrastructure may create new opportunities in 
the infrastructure sector. Further, more frequent 
and severe climate and weather shocks reinforce the 
growing demand for resilient infrastructure.

IS YOUR PORTFOLIO RESILIENT TO GROWING RISKS?

We believe equity-linked structured notes can work well 
in the current environment, for investors who qualify. 
Our clients seem to agree: Twice as many are utilizing 
structured notes this year relative to 2024.

Many equity-linked structured notes pay a coupon, 
periodically or at maturity. This coupon is a function 
of implied equity market volatility and interest rates. 
We believe both will remain elevated relative to 
recent history, potentially providing greater downside 
protection, higher potential coupons, or both.

Equity-linked structured notes create another lever that 
qualified investors can pull to generate income that is 
not correlated to fixed income markets. Indeed, these 
equity-linked structured notes can generate higher

And given the outperformance of U.S. assets over the

The recent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar has 
sparked spirited debate. Does weakness in the dollar 
call into question its role as the world’s reserve currency 
and, more broadly, the status of the United States as a 
hegemon in the global economy? Or does the decline 
signal a significant but not existential change? 
We’re inclined to take the second view, as we 
discuss below. 
The U.S. dollar has long served as the world’s reserve 
currency, and for good reason. The United States 
commands the largest9 and most stable economy in 
the world, and the deepest and most liquid financial 
markets. It has a well-established and consistent rule 
of law, strong institutions, fair and free elections, 
open and transparent political processes, relatively 
consistent regulatory and tax regimes, and a culture 
of innovation and entrepreneurship. The U.S. military 
provides the security backbone that underpins the 
global economic system. 
However, every reserve currency, from the Spanish 
galleon to the British pound, has eventually lost 
its primacy. Today, the dollar seems to face more 
potential downside risks than it has in decades. So 
far this year, the dollar has lost value relative to every 
other major currency. Tariff rollouts and trade policy 
uncertainty are parts of the story. But investors are also 
concerned about the U.S. fiscal outlook amid potential 
Congressional legislation that could substantially 
increase the budget deficit. 
The risk for markets is that U.S. policymakers repeat 
the mistakes of Latin American leaders such as former 
Argentinian President Juan Peron: protectionism, lack 
of central bank independence and a broader disregard 
for macroeconomic stability. Ironically, many Latin 
American economies have made substantial progress in 
these areas just as market participants are increasingly 
questioning U.S. economic credibility.    
But we believe those risks will manifest in a more 
subtle erosion of the dollar’s value, and not a sudden 
collapse. Today, the dollar makes up 60% of foreign 
exchange reserves, 65% of international debt and nearly 
85% of SWIFT trade finance settlements. Network effects 
are powerful; moving to a new medium for international 
trade and financing likely would not occur quickly. The 
second most used currency, the euro, accounts for just 
6% of SWIFT settlements.10

The primacy of the dollar seems durable, but at the 
margin, investors may be shifting their perceptions of 
the dollar’s value. Nearly 70% of investors surveyed 
think the dollar is “overvalued,” and a net 61%, the 
highest share since 2006, expect it to continue to 
depreciate.11 Our base case is that the dollar loses a few 
more percentage points by the end of the year against 
major currencies, with risks tilted to the downside. 
The historical precedents of sustained dollar weakness 
(1970–1980, 1985–1992 and 2002–2008) resulted in 
~40% depreciation over a 5- to 10-year period. Academic 
estimates suggest that ex-U.S. investors own ~30% of 
U.S.-issued fixed income and equity (public and private) 
securities.12 Even marginal repatriation could result 
in a significant change in relative valuations between 
U.S. and rest-of-world assets. 
Diversifying currency exposure can mitigate potential 
losses associated with dollar depreciation. We are 
focused on the euro, Japanese yen and gold due to 
their size, liquidity and historical roles as alternative 
reserve assets. Central banks, with nearly $13 trillion in 
reserves, have already increased allocations to these 
currencies, reflecting their deep, liquid markets and 
potential for preserving purchasing power. The euro 
and yen also have a lower correlation to global growth, 
which reduces cyclical exposure within a portfolio. 
Currency diversification probably comes more naturally 
to investors outside of the United States than to those 
inside the United States. The path of least resistance 
for U.S.-based investors could be exposure to equities 
denominated in the euro and yen. In fact, J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s 2025 Long-Term Capital Market 
Assumptions suggest that U.S. dollar depreciation will 
add 1%–2% annually to total returns for European and 
Japanese equity investments in U.S. dollar terms for the 
next 10–15 years. 
Importantly, those equity markets are also expected 
to outperform the United States on an absolute basis. 
Investing in private equity investments could also be a 
way to diversify geographic and currency exposure. U.S. 
equities make up between 70% and 75% of public equity 
benchmarks, but they account for only half of global 
buyout volumes.13 
Investors may also consider foreign currency 
denominated bonds, but they should understand the 
risks involved. A dollar-based investor in an unhedged 
ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio experienced almost 
2x the volatility of a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio 
over the last 20 years.

IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar 
We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most 
troubled developed market is the United Kingdom, 
where investors seem to have become disillusioned 
with fiscal policy. In 2025, the noise surrounding the 
dollar has been greater than the observed market 
stress, despite the dramatic moves in the middle of 
April. So far in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen 
simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds 
and currencies. 
In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline. 
Investors still have time to mitigate the impacts on 
their portfolios. 
IN RECENT YEARS, INVESTORS HAVE SOLD U.K. ASSETS MUCH MORE 
FREQUENTLY THAN U.S. ASSETS

IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?

Tracking the market’s 
perception of the dollar

We track one simple metric to assess the risk that U.S. 
policymakers are losing credibility with markets: the 
percentage of trading days in which stocks, bonds 
and the U.S. dollar all lose value. U.S. assets have 
experienced these simultaneous declines in around 
7.5% of trading days over the last three years. In Brazil, 
the share is upward of 20% of trading days. The most 
troubled developed market is the United Kingdom, 
where investors seem to have become disillusioned 
with fiscal policy. In 2025, the noise surrounding the 
dollar has been greater than the observed market 
stress, despite the dramatic moves in the middle of 
April. So far in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen 
simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds 
and currencies.

In short: We do not believe that the U.S. dollar's status 
as the world's reserve currency will suddenly vanish. 
But there is an elevated risk of an era of dollar decline. 
Investors still have time to mitigate the impacts on 
their portfolios.

IN RECENT YEARS, INVESTORS HAVE SOLD U.K. ASSETS MUCH MORE 
FREQUENTLY THAN U.S. ASSETS

The uncertainty surrounding tariff policy has distracted 
investors from another important secular trend: 
artificial intelligence. 
Even before “Liberation Day,” AI-linked stocks hit a wall 
during the March sell-off in U.S. equity markets. Twenty 
companies – nearly two-thirds of them exposed to AI – 
accounted for 80% of the year-to-date peak-to-trough

DeepSeek challenged many of investors’ prevailing 
assumptions about the resources needed to develop 
high-performing AI models (e.g., capital, leading-edge 
semiconductor chips and power). In other words, 
DeepSeek could accomplish quite a lot, and at a much 
lower cost than its competitors. 
In the wake of the DeepSeek news, investors questioned 
whether the so-called hyperscalers (providers of cloud

their aggressive capex – and whether, and when, these 
investments would pay off. 
Hyperscalers, including Amazon and Meta, say they are 
full steam ahead. Wall Street analysts are now penciling 
in nearly 33% capex growth from the four major 
hyperscalers over 2025 versus estimates of just over 
20% capex growth at the start of the year.14 
Confidence in greater 
AI-driven productivity 
We feel confident that AI will catalyze substantial 
productivity gains for businesses, consumers and the 
economy as a whole. Large language models can now 
deliver PhD-level outputs, while their costs have declined 
by between 80% and 99%. Further, users are increasingly 
able to optimize their mixes of cost and performance. 
Economic history is replete with examples of technologies 
that enabled adoption after costs declined dramatically 
(e.g., the Bessemer process of mass producing steel 
from molten iron, air travel, personal computers and 
semiconductors, mobile phones).

As influential technology analyst Ben Thompson has 
argued, the AI race is at an interesting juncture. Leading 
research labs are still incentivized to raise funds and 
invest in new models: They are competing to develop 
a model that can improve itself. At the same time, 
competition could drive prices lower, which encourages 
differentiation and further adoption.15 
We think agentic AI, programs that can operate with a 
human-like level of intelligence and independence, will 
likely dominate the next wave of software. We believe 
market leaders will deliver both a better consumer 
experience and productivity gains for enterprises 
across sectors and geographies. 
Indeed, the tech sectors in Europe and China were 
closing the performance gap with U.S.-based tech 
companies – after the release of ChatGPT in November 
2022 and before the tariff shock hit markets. Finally, 
private market exposure is crucial to accessing the trend 
of AI expansion. Out of nearly 100,000 investable 
software companies, only ~4,000 are public.16 
The ultimate winners of the AI race may not yet exist. 
The rise of cloud computing and the transition to mobile 
phones in the 2010s created more than 30 companies 
with greater than US$1 billion in annual revenues 
(accounting for over US$1.9 trillion in public market 
capitalization).17 The total addressable market for AI-
related applications could surpass both the cloud and 
mobile transitions, largely because the ultimate target is 
employee compensation costs. 
Skeptics of the AI boom point to the dot-com bubble 
of the late 1990s. Before the bubble popped in 2000, 
many companies sported excessive valuations premised 
on business models that proved to be inadequate or 
non-existent. And even companies with viable business 
models struggled to justify their peak valuations. The 
U.S. and European telecoms that built most of today’s 
communication infrastructure (mobile, broadband, 
fiber optic networks) have never regained their 2000 
peaks, even as cell phone subscriptions have increased 
over tenfold. 
In our view, neither the levels of AI capex nor stock 
valuations suggest an AI bubble in the market. Stock 
prices have risen with earnings, and capex has not been 
financed with equity or debt issuance. But we are closely 
monitoring payback on AI projects and pockets of froth 
(in valuations and/or capex levels) in sectors such as 
data centers. 
The most recent earnings data suggests that AI is 
starting to deliver for companies and investors. AI 
demand contributed nearly half of the 35% growth 
reported by Microsoft’s cloud computing unit, and the 
company processed over 100 trillion AI tokens in the 
first quarter, a 5x increase from last year. 
We will continue to focus on companies and sectors 
poised to benefit from cost savings and productivity 
gains from AI technology (e.g., software and financials). 
We will also look for promising names in the agentic 
application space.

Most of Wall Street expected an immediate revival in 
dealmaking and capital market activity in the wake of 
Donald Trump’s electoral victory. From election night 
until the end of January, the capital markets subsector 
(which includes investment banks and alternative 
asset managers) rallied 10%, doubling the broad 
market’s 5% rally. 
Hopes of a dealmaking boom soon met the reality of 
tariff-driven uncertainty, still-elevated interest rates 
and choppy equity markets. While private market 
dealmaking continues at a reasonable pace, the public 
market arena (notably IPOs) has been very quiet. 
The capital markets sector has surrendered most of its 
post-election gains, and expectations for completed U.S. 
M&A activity have been revised down from 25% growth 
to just 7% growth.18 We spotted green shoots to start 
the year (global M&A activity rose 17% year-over-year 
in the first quarter, driven by sponsor-backed activity). 
But the prospect of prolonged uncertainty has created 
a cloudier outlook on the pace for dealmaking, at least 
over the near term.

As we discussed in our 2025 Outlook, it remains to be 
seen just how market friendly the new leadership at 
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will prove to be. 
FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson has opted to keep Biden-
era merger guidelines in place, disappointing market 
participants who hoped for changes. On the other hand, 
Ferguson’s FTC seems to focus its rule enforcement 
based on consumer welfare, a more market-friendly 
approach than Ferguson’s predecessor, Lina Khan, 
who aimed to correct market share imbalances. On the 
specific (and contentious) subject of Big Tech, the Trump 
FTC seems likely to maintain an adversarial stance.19 
Although the dealmaking environment may be sluggish, 
we do see signs that the private equity ecosystem is 
coming into better balance. In 2022 and 2023, capital 
calls exceeded distributions for the industry, putting 
investors in a negative cash flow position. In 2024, 
capital calls were in line with distributions.

A slower pace of traditional dealmaking activity (IPO, 
strategic M&A), along with aging assets in existing 
private equity portfolios, could create a compelling 
opportunity set for secondary managers that 
buy existing stakes from other sponsors. Historically, 
secondaries have been attractive for several reasons. 
First, they mitigate the “J-Curve” effect inherent in 
drawdown funds (early negative returns as capital 
is called, followed by positive returns as capital is 
distributed). In addition, secondary funds give investors 
visibility into a strategy’s underlying assets (mitigating 
blind pool risk), and provide meaningful diversification 
across vintage year and manager. The potential 
liquidity needs of college endowments is another 
potential catalyst that could lead to opportunity for 
secondary funds. 
Evergreen fund structures will likely alter the private 
market landscape. Just this year, over 4,500 clients 
have invested in evergreen structures for the first time. 
Currently, evergreen funds are ~5% of the overall private 
markets, and some estimate that share could grow to 
20% in the next decade.20 As private markets mature, 
we expect asset owners will find more opportunities 
for liquidity beyond the traditional avenues of IPOs and 
strategic M&A. 
Investors who only participate in public markets should 
realize that companies are staying private longer. Today, 
the median company that goes public is almost 14 years 
old. Ten years ago, the median age of an IPO was less 
than 11 years old.21 Of all the companies that exceed 
$100 million in annual revenue in the United States, 87% 
are private.22 
A key takeaway for suitable investors: Exposure to 
private markets could be critical to ensure proper 
exposure to the total economy. 
As the private equity ecosystem comes into better 
balance, the sports investment landscape is a notable 
bright spot. In the athletic arena, sports deals have 
continued to grow in terms of both number and 
volume. The sale of the Boston Celtics set a record for 
transaction valuation, and Peyton Manning’s sports-
focused Omaha Productions was recently valued at over 
$800 million.23 We believe the sports ecosystem could 
offer the opportunity for less correlated return streams 
across debt and equity investments. 
The private market landscape continues to evolve, 
driven by aging assets and growing evergreen funds. 
Investors should consider maintaining a balance 
between drawdown and evergreen structures as they 
build out their private equity portfolios, while also 
exploring investments in secondaries and sports.

WHAT’S THE DEAL WITH DEALMAKING?

A slower pace of traditional dealmaking activity (IPO, 
strategic M&A), along with aging assets in existing 
private equity portfolios, could create a compelling 
opportunity set for secondary managers that 
buy existing stakes from other sponsors. Historically, 
secondaries have been attractive for several reasons.

First, they mitigate the “J-Curve” effect inherent in 
drawdown funds (early negative returns as capital 
is called, followed by positive returns as capital is 
distributed). In addition, secondary funds give investors 
visibility into a strategy’s underlying assets (mitigating 
blind pool risk), and provide meaningful diversification 
across vintage year and manager. The potential 
liquidity needs of college endowments is another 
potential catalyst that could lead to opportunity for 
secondary funds.

Evergreen fund structures will likely alter the private 
market landscape. Just this year, over 4,500 clients 
have invested in evergreen structures for the first time. 
Currently, evergreen funds are ~5% of the overall private 
markets, and some estimate that share could grow to 
20% in the next decade.20 As private markets mature, 
we expect asset owners will find more opportunities 
for liquidity beyond the traditional avenues of IPOs and 
strategic M&A.

Conclusion 
The uncertainty is palpable. Many investors acknowledge the likelihood 
of continued market flux, but they’re not sure what to do about it. 
Perhaps the most powerful way to find clarity in a volatile world is to 
define the intent of your capital and understand the context of your 
wealth plan (your risk capacity and risk tolerance). In this way, you can 
feel more comfortable that your asset allocation decisions can move you 
closer to achieving your goals. 
We hope that our answers to the five essential questions help you unlock 
opportunity in uncertainty, and that the portfolio implications we discuss 
give you the comfort you need to stay dedicated to your wealth plan.

Important Information 
Key Risks 
Investing in alternative assets involves higher risks than 
traditional investments and is suitable only for sophisticated 
investors. Alternative investments involve greater risks than 
traditional investments and should not be deemed a complete 
investment program. They are not tax-efficient, and an investor 
should consult with his/her tax advisor prior to investing. 
Alternative investments have higher fees than traditional 
investments, and they may also be highly leveraged and 
engage in speculative investment techniques, which can 
magnify the potential for investment loss or gain. The value of 
the investment may fall as well as rise, and investors may get 
back less than they invested. 
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility 
than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the 
instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked 
derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall 
market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in 
interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or 
commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, 
embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and 
regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked 
derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the 
same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Investments in emerging markets may not be suitable for all 
investors. Emerging markets involve a greater degree of risk 
and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and 
differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the United 
States can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may 
not be as politically and economically stable as the United States 
and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more 
volatile. 
The price of equity securities may rise or fall due to the changes 
in the broad market or changes in a company’s financial condition, 
sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject 
to “stock market risk” meaning that stock prices in general may 
decline over short or extended periods of time. 
Investing in fixed income products is subject to certain risks, 
including interest rate, credit, inflation, call, prepayment and 
reinvestment risk. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed 
prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss. 
As a reminder, hedge funds (or funds of hedge funds) often 
engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices 
that may increase the risk of investment loss. These investments 
can be highly illiquid, and are not required to provide periodic 
pricing or valuation information to investors, and may involve 
complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax 
information. These investments are not subject to the same 
regulatory requirements as mutual funds; and often charge high 
fees. Further, any number of conflicts of interest may exist in the 
context of the management and/or operation of any such fund. 
For complete information, please refer to the applicable offering 
memorandum. 
High yield bonds are speculative, non-investment grade bonds 
that have higher risk of default or other adverse credit events that 
are appropriate for high-risk investors only. 
Not all option strategies are suitable for all investors. Certain 
strategies may expose investors to significant potential risks 
and losses. For additional risk information, please read the 
“Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”: http://www. 
theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. We advise 
investors to consult their tax advisors and legal counsel about 
the tax implications of these strategies. Investors are urged to 
carefully consider whether options or option-related products or 
strategies are suitable for their needs. 
Preferred investments share characteristics of both stocks and 
bonds. Preferred securities are typically long-dated securities with 
call protection that fall in between debt and equity in the capital 
structure. Preferred securities carry various risks and considerations, 
which include: concentration risk; interest rate risk; lower credit 
ratings than individual bonds; a lower claim to assets than a firm’s 
individual bonds; higher yields due to these risk characteristics; and 
“callable” implications meaning the issuing company may redeem the 
stock at a certain price after a certain date. 
Investing in Structured Notes involves a number of significant 
risks. We have set forth certain risk factors and other investment 
considerations relating to the investment below. Not all 
investments are suitable (or in the best interest) for all investors. 
You should analyze the Structured Notes based on your individual 
circumstances, taking into account such factors as investment 
objectives, tolerance for risk, and liquidity needs.

regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked 
derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the 
same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.

Investments in emerging markets may not be suitable for all 
investors. Emerging markets involve a greater degree of risk 
and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and 
differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the United 
States can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may 
not be as politically and economically stable as the United States 
and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more 
volatile.

The price of equity securities may rise or fall due to the changes 
in the broad market or changes in a company’s financial condition, 
sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject 
to “stock market risk” meaning that stock prices in general may 
decline over short or extended periods of time.

Investing in fixed income products is subject to certain risks, 
including interest rate, credit, inflation, call, prepayment and 
reinvestment risk. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed 
prior to maturity may be subject to substantial gain or loss.

As a reminder, hedge funds (or funds of hedge funds) often 
engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices 
that may increase the risk of investment loss. These investments 
can be highly illiquid, and are not required to provide periodic 
pricing or valuation information to investors, and may involve 
complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax 
information. These investments are not subject to the same 
regulatory requirements as mutual funds; and often charge high 
fees. Further, any number of conflicts of interest may exist in the 
context of the management and/or operation of any such fund. 
For complete information, please refer to the applicable offering 
memorandum.

High yield bonds are speculative, non-investment grade bonds 
that have higher risk of default or other adverse credit events that 
are appropriate for high-risk investors only.

Not all option strategies are suitable for all investors. Certain 
strategies may expose investors to significant potential risks 
and losses. For additional risk information, please read the 
“Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”: http://www. 
theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. We advise 
investors to consult their tax advisors and legal counsel about 
the tax implications of these strategies. Investors are urged to 
carefully consider whether options or option-related products or 
strategies are suitable for their needs.

Preferred investments share characteristics of both stocks and 
bonds. Preferred securities are typically long-dated securities with 
call protection that fall in between debt and equity in the capital 
structure. Preferred securities carry various risks and considerations, 
which include: concentration risk; interest rate risk; lower credit 
ratings than individual bonds; a lower claim to assets than a firm’s 
individual bonds; higher yields due to these risk characteristics; and 
“callable” implications meaning the issuing company may redeem the 
stock at a certain price after a certain date.

Investing in Structured Notes involves a number of significant 
risks. We have set forth certain risk factors and other investment 
considerations relating to the investment below. Not all 
investments are suitable (or in the best interest) for all investors. 
You should analyze the Structured Notes based on your individual 
circumstances, taking into account such factors as investment 
objectives, tolerance for risk, and liquidity needs.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR 
INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS 
OF INTEREST 
Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. or any of its affiliates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual 
or perceived economic or other incentive in its management of 
our clients’ portfolios to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. 
Conflicts will result, for example (to the extent the following 
activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan 
invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, 
structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund 
issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, 
such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. 
Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and 
trade clearing, from an affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives 
payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a 
client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for 
providing services (including shareholder servicing, recordkeeping 
or custody) with respect to investment products purchased 
for a client’s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of 
relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. 
Morgan acts for its own account. 
Investment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan 
and third-party asset managers and are subject to a 
review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of 
strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies 
we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views 
in order to meet the portfolio’s investment objective. 
As a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. 
We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies 
will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for 
example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable 
law and any account-specific considerations. 
While our internally managed strategies generally align well with 
our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment
