Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January  26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of
results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
In June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein have been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Fiscal Year
Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The first quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week
quarters.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,
investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other
charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of
information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing the
effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the year ending January 25, 2026.
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,
including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within
each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.

Note 4 - Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income
before income tax was an expense of 14.3% and 13.9% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-
derived intangible income deduction.
Our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from
the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S.
federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.
Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the
near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could
vary based on our assessment of all available information.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position
will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal,
state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise
resolved with the respective tax authorities.

(2)    Revenue recognized includes $6.0 billion and $123 million related to customer advances for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
We recognized revenue of $265 million and $188 million in the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively, that were included in the prior year end
deferred revenue balance.
As of April  27, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8  billion, which includes
$1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue. Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts
greater than one year in length will be recognized over the next twelve months.
Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign
currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. During the first quarter of
fiscal years 2026 and 2025, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not
significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign
currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:

As of April 27, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months were not significant.

(1)    Deferred revenue additions includes $6.2 billion and $157 million of customer advances for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

(2)    Revenue recognized includes $6.0 billion and $123 million related to customer advances for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

We recognized revenue of $265 million and $188 million in the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively, that were included in the prior year end
deferred revenue balance.

As of April  27, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in length was $1.8  billion, which includes
$1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $160 million which has not yet been billed nor recognized as revenue. Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts
greater than one year in length will be recognized over the next twelve months.

Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign
currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. During the first quarter of
fiscal years 2026 and 2025, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not
significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign
currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.

The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of April 27, 2025 and January 26, 2025.

As of April 27, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months were not significant.

As of April 27, 2025, we complied with the required covenants, which are non-financial in nature, under the outstanding notes.
Commercial Paper
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of April 27, 2025, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations reflect our commitment to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including long-term supply and capacity
agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and long-lived assets.
As of April 27, 2025, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling $29.8 billion, an increase from the prior year
led by commitments, capacity and components for our Blackwell architecture. We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure
inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are cancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business
needs prior to placing firm orders. Though, changes to these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were
$13.7  billion, including $10.6  billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect our cloud service agreements to primarily be used to support our
research and development efforts, as well as our DGX Cloud offerings.

Litigation
Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended
complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand
between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to
dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from
judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel
affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in
dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to
reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay
the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter.
NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of
certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued
judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the
case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed
January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once
the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,
purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and
violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and
improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et
al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition for writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties
discuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. On March 7, 2025, the district court adopted the parties' stipulation to
extend the stay until the final and complete resolution of the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on
behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information,
corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements
related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including
disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.
Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.
2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and
insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on
GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of
unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation
action.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of April 27, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while
reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged
in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the
ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.
Note 12 - Shareholders’ Equity 
Capital Return Program 
We repurchased 126 million and 99 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion and $8.0 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.
Note 13 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for
purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our CODM assesses operating performance of each segment based on regularly provided
segment revenue and segment operating income. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and costs or

respectively. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.

From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.

We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.

Note 13 - Segment Information

Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for
purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our CODM assesses operating performance of each segment based on regularly provided
segment revenue and segment operating income. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and costs or

basis, and expenses attributable to each segment are not regularly provided to our CODM.
The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and artificial intelligence, or AI, solutions and software;
networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and DGX Cloud computing
services.
The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for
gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that are not allocated to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or
assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and
other costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. There are no intersegment transactions. The accounting
policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.
On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we
initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the
new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable
to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the
interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that
receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Overview

Our Company and Our Businesses

NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin
applications.

Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.
Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and
regional cloud service providers.

On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or
to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we
initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the
new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable
to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the
interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that
receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Raw Text:
We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity
and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.
We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin
shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased
inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.
The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly
important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our
competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services.
Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large
language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.
The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.
In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a
worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z
ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200
and GB200. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements
of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that
could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to
do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt
supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.
Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.

On April 9, 2025, we were informed by the USG that a license is required for exports of our H20 products into the China market. As a result of these new
requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the
demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our
H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have
impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue.
Revenue was $44.1 billion, up 69% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially.
Data Center revenue was $39.1 billion, up 73% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand
for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We saw our
Blackwell architecture ramp expand to all customer categories, while large cloud service providers remained our largest at just under 50% of Data Center
revenue. Data Center compute revenue was $34.2 billion, up 76% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Networking revenue was $5.0 billion, up 56% from a
year ago and up 64% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric in our GB200 systems and continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at
cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.
Gaming revenue was up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture.
Professional Visualization revenue was up 19% from a year ago and flat sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by broader adoption of Ada RTX
workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.
Automotive revenue was up 72% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially. The increase from a year ago was driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.
Gross margin decreased from a year ago and sequentially, primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations
and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Operating expenses were up 44% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits
expenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and compute, infrastructure and engineering development costs for new product introductions.
The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth.

Compute & Networking revenue – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by demand for our accelerated computing
platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. Revenue from Data Center computing grew
76% year-on-year compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, driven by demand for our Blackwell computing platform. Revenue from Data Center
networking grew 56% year-on-year compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric in our GB200 systems and
continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

Graphics revenue – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture.

Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026
was driven by growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations. The year over year
increase in Graphics segment operating income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
reflecting employee growth.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B,
represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two
direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking
segment.
Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two
indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated
to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through
one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5
billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase
obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess
inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the
first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.

The increase in interest income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and debt securities.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other income (expense), net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity securities, publicly-held equity
securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other income (expense), net, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025,
was primarily driven by unrealized losses in our publicly-held equity securities due to fair value volatility in our investments, particularly CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.
Refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional
information regarding our investments in non-marketable equity securities and publicly-held equity securities.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income
before income tax was an expense of 14.3% and 13.9% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-
derived intangible income deduction.
Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the
near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could
vary based on our assessment of all available information.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to higher revenue and
timing of cash collections.
Cash used in investing activities decreased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by lower net
purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, mainly due to higher share
repurchases.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. As of April 27, 2025, we had $53.7
billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next
twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and
capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly-rated corporations
and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable
securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
Except for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at
the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We plan to make two
estimated federal and state tax payments in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, a substantial increase as compared with no estimated tax payments in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2026.
Capital Return to Shareholders
We repurchased 126 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized,
subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.
From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of April  27, 2025, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information
we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing a phased upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or
ERP, system to update our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating
results. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 11  of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 26, 2025. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, and below. Any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or
reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are
immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Long manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and capacity availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately, has
led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting
the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,
provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue.
We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.
If we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply
commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both
product shortages and excess inventory, significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and
contract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased

customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share.
Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component
have had and may have a broader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for
the finished products are not available from third parties.
If we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory
or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for
certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may
have to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical
lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to
increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of
these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Factors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,
include:
•
changes in product development cycles and time to market;
•
competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
•
changes in business and economic conditions;
•
sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;
•
rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
•
the availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
•
new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;
•
new or unexpected end-use cases;
•
increase in demand for competitive products;
•
changes in end-user demand;
•
purchasing decisions made, and inventory levels held by, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, system integrators, other channel partners and other third parties;
•
the ability of developers, end customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms;
•
the availability of third-party content on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW;
•
the demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
•
changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
•
government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls, increased restrictions on gaming usage, or tariffs; and
•
our customers' ability to invest in AI infrastructure.
Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan
and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to
our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us. Publicly announced intentions by governments or other companies to purchase our products
can further complicate our demand estimates, as such announcements are often non-binding and may not result in committed volumes.
We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our
data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both
current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates

more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying
component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if
our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. Our ability to increase
manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume timely. Delays or
shortfalls could impact our ability to meet demand.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support
new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive
products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of
AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions
each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product
configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Qualification
time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product
introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation
architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future
architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as
planned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that
could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter
of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products
or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be
able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product
transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our
supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.
Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able
to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any
reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
The use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our products, including by leading to
inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum.
It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of
cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in
cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain
transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate
demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and
may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs,
which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may
be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete
with our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demand that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our
revenue.
We are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may
adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product
regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.

could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no
assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have
designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions
on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their
interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs, and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply
our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation,
regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to
increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and
China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP
market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from
competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA
products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation
models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and
system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such
requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers,
and partners.
Governments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop
frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year
transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already
enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.
Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of
new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to
laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties
or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the
timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively
impact our business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.
Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.
Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.
As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control
restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated

could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no
assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have
designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions
on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their
interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs, and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply
our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation,
regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to
increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and
China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP
market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from
competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA
products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation
models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and
system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such
requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers,
and partners.

Governments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop
frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year
transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already
enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.
Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of
new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to
laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties
or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the
timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively
impact our business and results of operations.

Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.

For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.

The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.

Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.

products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and
warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our
business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly
likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to
similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and
semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,
repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide
services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even
outside China.
Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related
supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our
research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to
serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide
our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about
our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example,
regulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If
regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties,
restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our
operations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside
the United States.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and
supercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed
us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in
the Middle East.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and
D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply
to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China.
On April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies
headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect
bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with
H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.
The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance
density” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data
center market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute
market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Raw Text:
In addition to controls targeting D:4 and D:5 countries, the USG has also imposed worldwide export controls impacting our products, and may impose additional
controls in the future. On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the
IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a,
4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data
center products, such as our H200 and GB200. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status,
and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals.
In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the
forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could
have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Our competitive position has been harmed by export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there
are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers
purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service
obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the
USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose
not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support
efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in
China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements.
For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example
by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking
and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. Such
government mandates in chip designs could introduce system vulnerabilities and expose us to significant risk and potential liability, negatively impact demand for
our products, and could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Open-source foundation models are rapidly growing in popularity with developers worldwide. Any regulatory control or other restriction that limits our ability to
provide products and services that support third-party applications and models, including applications built on foundation models originating in China such as
DeepSeek or Qwen, could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it
may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S.
and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in
markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused
in and distributed from Hong Kong.
Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our
GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream
parties to create large clusters for frontier model training.
Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of
our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China
and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they
are able to serve markets worldwide. Export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our
customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results.
As a result, export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin
America, and Southeast Asia. Export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S.

advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale,
resulting in excess inventory and purchase obligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in
foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
The increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek to
strictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with
partners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations may
negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.
In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United
States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also
considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.
Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.
Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage
customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing
components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing
certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new
standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the
Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,
this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results
and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our
business and financial results.

The increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek to
strictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with
partners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations may
negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.

In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United
States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also
considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.
Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.

Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage
customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing
components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing
certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new
standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the
Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the new standard,
this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results
and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.

Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our
business and financial results.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

We repurchased 126 million and 99 million shares of our common stock for $14.5 billion and $8.0 billion during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. As of April 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of our common stock.

The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase
agreements in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. Our share
repurchase program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $98 million during the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The payment of
future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.

From April 28, 2025 through May 23, 2025, we repurchased 19 million shares for $2.3 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase
program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue
additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
Employee Equity Incentive Program Share Withholding
We withhold shares of our common stock associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations of awards under our employee equity
incentive program. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we withheld approximately 13 million shares for a total value of $1.5 billion through net share
settlements.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds
On March 14, 2025, we acquired a company and agreed to issue to key employees a total of 363,818 shares of our common stock, valued at $44.3 million
based on our closing stock price on the acquisition date. The shares will be issued in installments commencing in fiscal year 2026 and through fiscal year 2030.
On March 24, 2025, we acquired a company and issued to key employees a total of 686,446 shares of our common stock, valued at $83.3 million based on our
closing stock price on the issuance date.
The above securities were issued in transactions not involving a public offering pursuant to an exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act (and Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder).
