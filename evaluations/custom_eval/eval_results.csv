"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","Year-over-Year Revenue Growth Rates  
- Total revenue: +39% Y/Y (Q1 2024→Q1 2025) (Page 21)  
- Total revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44% Y/Y (Page 22)  
- US revenue: +55% Y/Y (Page 18)  

Standard deviation of those three Y/Y growth rates  
Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46.0%  
Deviations: (39–46)=–7, (44–46)=–2, (55–46)=+9  
Variance = [(–7)²+(–2)²+(+9)²]/3 = 44.67

Quarter-over-Quarter Changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023→Q1 2025) (Page 32)  
Q2 → Q3 2023: 46–38 = +8 pp  
Q3 → Q4 2023: 54–46 = +8 pp  
Q4 → Q1 2024: 57–54 = +3 pp  
Q1 → Q2 2024: 64–57 = +7 pp

Mean change = 45/7 ≈ 6.43 pp  
Variance = Σ(deviations²)/7 ≈ 12.24

Relation to Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score  
– Despite moderate volatility in Y/Y revenue growth (σ≈6.7 pp) and quarter-to-quarter Rule of 40 changes (σ≈3.5 pp), Palantir’s Rule of 40 reached a record 83% in Q1 2025 (Page 32), underscoring that underlying growth and margin acceleration have outpaced their own variability.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?",Palantir’s operating expense per US commercial customer decreased by 22.93% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.,"Operating expense per US commercial customer decreased by ~16.9% Y/Y.

Calculation:
- Q1 2024 op exp = $610 M – $254 M = $356 M (Page 22; Page 23)

"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","The ratio of the standard deviations is 1.33, indicating that US commercial customer count quarter-over-quarter growth was 1.33 times more volatile than total customer count growth, suggesting that despite management’s reported 65% year-over-year expansion the segment’s quarterly performance exhibited greater variability.","Here’s the math:

1. Quarter-over-quarter growth rates for the trailing twelve months ended March 31 2025:

   • Total Customer Count (Page 25): +7%, +6%, +13%, +8%  
   • US Commercial Customer Count (Page 24): +13%, +9%, +19%, +13%

2. Compute the population standard deviations:

   stdev(total)  = √[ ( (7−8.5)² + (6−8.5)² + (13−8.5)² + (8−8.5)² ) / 4 ]  
                 = √[ (2.25 + 6.25 + 20.25 + 0.25) / 4 ]  
                 = √(7.25) ≈ 2.69 %  

   stdev(US com) = √[ ( (13−13.5)² + (9−13.5)² + (19−13.5)² + (13−13.5)² ) / 4 ]  
                 = √[ (0.25 + 20.25 + 30.25 + 0.25) / 4 ]  
                 = √(12.75) ≈ 3.57 %

3. Ratio of volatilities:

   ratio = stdev(US com) / stdev(total)  
         ≈ 3.57 % / 2.69 %  
         ≈ 1.33

Interpretation: US commercial customer count growth is about 1.3× as volatile quarter-to-quarter as overall customer count growth, even though management is reporting a steady +65% year-over-year increase in the US commercial base. This suggests that while US commercial expansion is very strong on an annual basis, its quarterly pacing has been somewhat more variable than the company’s total customer additions.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
