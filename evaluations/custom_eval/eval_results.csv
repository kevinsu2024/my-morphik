"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","1. Year-over-year growth rates  
   • Total revenue: 39% (Page 21, Node 103)  
   • Total revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts: 44% (Page 22, Node 104)  
   • US revenue: 55% (Page 18, Node 100)  

2. Standard deviation of those three Y/Y rates  
   Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46%  
   Variance = [(39−46)² + (44−46)² + (55−46)²]/3 = (49 + 4 + 81)/3 = 44.667  
   Std dev ≈ √44.667 = 6.7 percentage points  

3. Quarter-over-quarter changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023→Q1 2025) (Page 32, Node 114)  
   Rule 40 scores: 38%, 46%, 54%, 57%, 64%, 68%, 81%, 83%  
   Q-to-Q changes: +8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2

   Std dev ≈ √12.24 = 3.5 percentage points  

4. Relation to Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score  
   The dispersion of Y/Y revenue growth (σ≈6.7 pp) exceeds the volatility of quarter-to-quarter Rule of 40 changes (σ≈3.5 pp), reflecting more consistent quarterly improvements in combined margin + growth, culminating in an 83% Rule of 40 in Q1 2025 (Page 32, Node 114).",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
