"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and US revenue grew 39%, 44% and 55% year-over-year, respectively; the standard deviation of those growth rates was 6.68 percentage points; the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025 was 3.50 percentage points; and these volatility measures align with the Company’s 83% Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025.","The three year-over-year revenue growth rates between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 are:  
• Total revenue: +39% (634 → 884 MM) (Page 21)  
• Total revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts: +44% (610 → 879 MM) (Page 22)  
• US revenue: +55% (406 → 628 MM) (Page 18)  

Standard deviation of those three Ys:  
 mean = (39% + 44% + 55%)/3 = 46%  
 variance = [(39–46)²+(44–46)²+(55–46)²]/3 = 44.67  
 σ = √44.67 ≈ 6.7%  

The Rule of 40 scores by quarter (Q2 ’23–Q1 ’25) are: 38%, 46%, 54%, 57%, 64%, 68%, 81%, 83% (Page 32)  
the quarter-over-quarter changes are: +8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2 (pp)  
 mean change ≈ 6.43pp  
 variance = [∑(Δ–6.43)²]/7 ≈ 12.24  
 σ = √12.24 ≈ 3.5 pp  

Q1 2025’s Rule of 40 score is 83% (Page 32).  
– The revenue growth rates themselves show a moderate dispersion (σ≈6.7%), while the Rule of 40 has improved quarter-to-quarter with lower volatility (σ≈3.5pp), culminating in a very strong 83% Rule of 40 in Q1 2025.",CORRECT,Answers are equivalent (allowing for minor stylistic differences)
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?",Palantir’s operating expense per US commercial customer decreased by 22.93% year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.,"Operating expense per US commercial customer fell by roughly 23% year-over-year.

• Q1 2024 US commercial customer count = 262 (TTM Mar 31 2024) (Page 24)
