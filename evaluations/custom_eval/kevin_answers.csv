"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total Revenue Y/Y Growth: 39% (Page 3)  
Revenue Excl Strategic Y/Y Growth: 44% (Page 22)  
US Revenue Y/Y Growth: 55% (Page 18)  

Std Dev of those three Y/Y growth rates: 6.68%  
Calculation: mean=(39+44+55)/3=46%; σ=√[( (39−46)²+(44−46)²+(55−46)² )/3]=√(134/3)=6.68%  

Rule of 40 Quarter-over-Quarter changes (Q2 2023→Q1 2025): +8%, +8%, +3%, +7%, +4%, +13%, +2% (Page 32)  
Std Dev of those seven changes: 3.50%  
Calculation: mean=6.43%; σ=√[(1.57²+1.57²+(−3.43)²+0.57²+(−2.43)²+6.57²+(−4.43)²)/7]=3.50%  

Q1 2025 Rule of 40 Score: 83% (Page 32)  
Relation: The Y/Y growth volatility (6.68%) and Rule of 40 q-o-q volatility (3.50%) are both far below the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score of 83%, underscoring exceptionally strong and stable operating leverage."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","-17.1%

Calculation:
Q1 2024 operating expense per customer = ( $610.44 M – $254 M ) / 262 = $356.44 M / 262 = $1.361 M (Pg 31; Pg 23; Pg 24)  
Q1 2025 operating expense per customer = ( $878.708 M – $391 M ) / 432 = $487.708 M / 432 = $1.129 M (Pg 31; Pg 23; Pg 24)  
% change = (1.129 – 1.361) / 1.361 × 100 = –17.1%"

1) the foreign-derived intangible income deduction,  
2) stock-based compensation,  
3) income earned in jurisdictions taxed below 21%, and
