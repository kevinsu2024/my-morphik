"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue Y/Y growth: 39% (Page 21)  
Total revenue excl. strategic commercial contracts Y/Y growth: 44% (Page 22)  
US revenue Y/Y growth: 55% (Page 18)  
Std dev of these three growth rates: 6.68%  
Calculation: mean=(39+44+55)/3=46; σ=√[((39−46)²+(44−46)²+(55−46)²)/3]=√(134/3)=6.68%  

QoQ changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023→Q1 2025): [8, 8, 3, 7, 4, 13, 2]  
Std dev of these changes: 3.50%  
Calculation: mean=45/7=6.43; σ=√(∑(Δ−6.43)²/7)=√(85.69/7)=3.50%  

Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score: 83% (Page 32)  

The revenue‐growth metrics show higher volatility (σ=6.68pp) than the quarter-on-quarter Rule of 40 changes (σ=3.50pp), and the strong 83% Rule of 40 in Q1 2025 sits well above its historical mean with moderate QoQ variability."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","-17.1%

Calculation:
Q1 2024 operating expense per customer = (610,440 – 254,000)/262 = 356,440/262 ≈ 1.361 ($M) (Page 31; Page 23; Page 24)  
Q1 2025 operating expense per customer = (878,708 – 391,000)/432 = 487,708/432 ≈ 1.129 ($M) (Page 31; Page 23; Page 24)  
% change = (1.129 – 1.361)/1.361 × 100% ≈ –17.1%"
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","363 million; 261 million; 39.0%

363 = 6,788 – 6,425 (Page 14)  
261 = 408 – 147 (Page 14)  
39.0% = 159/408 × 100 (Page 13)"
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","$408 million

Calculation:
$1,251 million (publicly-held equity securities fair value at Apr 27, 2025) − $843 million (reclassification adjustment) = $408 million (Page 12)"
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","42% (Adjusted FCF margin) (Page 3); 9% (US government revenue Q/Q growth) (Page 3); $5.4 B (cash, cash equivalents & US Treasury securities) (Page 27); 139 (deals ≥ $1 M) (Page 3); 432 (US Commercial Customer Count, TTM 3/31/25) (Page 24)"
"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","The combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net grew faster by 23.1 percentage points.

Calculations:
1. Stock-based compensation + depreciation & amortization  
  2025: $1,474 + $611 = $2,085 (Page 7)  
  2024: $1,011 + $410 = $1,421 (Page 7)  
  Growth: (2,085 – 1,421)/1,421 = 46.7%

2. Net change in unrealized gain (loss) + total other income (expense), net  
  2025: $139 + $272 = $411 (Pages 4, 3)  
  2024: – $128 + $370 = $242 (Pages 4, 3)  
  Growth: (411 – 242)/242 = 69.8%

Difference: 69.8% – 46.7% = 23.1 percentage points"

Calculations:

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?",25 customers; 12.8% (622−427=195 total global growth; 432−262=170 US growth; 195−170=25 non-US; 25/195≈12.8%) (Page 25; Page 24)
"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?",CAGR ≈12.8% {[(349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1)×100]} (Page 21).

"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","1.36 = 3.65% / 2.68%

Calculation:
US commercial Q/Q growth rates = [12.6%, 8.8%, 19.0%, 13.1%] → σ=√[(∑(ri–r̄)²)/4]=3.65%   (Page 24)  
Total customer Q/Q growth rates = [7.04%, 6.07%, 13.04%, 8.16%] → σ=2.68%   (Page 25)

A ratio >1 (≈1.36) shows that US commercial customer additions are about 36% more volatile quarter-to-quarter than total customer count, indicating that despite a strong 65% Y/Y increase, US commercial growth experiences greater quarterly swings."
