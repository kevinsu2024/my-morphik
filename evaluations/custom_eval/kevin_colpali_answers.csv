"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue YoY growth: 39% (Page 21)  
Total revenue excl. Strategic Commercial Contracts YoY growth: 44% (Page 22)  
US revenue YoY growth: 55% (Page 18)  

Std. dev. of those three rates = 6.7%  
Calculation: mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 = 46;  
σ = √[((39−46)²+(44−46)²+(55−46)²)/3] = √(134/3) ≈ 6.68%  

QoQ changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 ’23→Q1 ’25): +8, +8, +3, +7, +4, +13, +2  
Std. dev. of these changes = 3.5%  
Calculation: mean = 45/7 ≈ 6.43;  
σ = √[∑(Δ−6.43)²/7] ≈ √(85.71/7) ≈ 3.50%  

Q1 ’25 Rule of 40 score: 83% (Page 3)  
→ The 6.7 pp volatility across revenue growth rates and the 3.5 pp volatility in QoQ Rule of 40 changes are modest relative to the high 83% Rule of 40 level in Q1 ’25."

Calculation: changes = 25,781–18,450=7,331; 26,355–23,656=2,699; 52,136–42,106=10,030; mean=6,686.7; σ=√[((7,331–6,686.7)²+(2,699–6,686.7)²+(10,030–6,686.7)²)/3] ≈3,028 (Page 11)
