"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","The provided document pages do not contain specific information about Palantir's Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, nor do they provide data on the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, or US revenue. Additionally, there is no information available regarding the standard deviation of these growth rates or the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025. Consequently, I cannot calculate or relate these volatility metrics to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025 based on the provided context.

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","To determine which grew faster on a year-over-year basis for NVIDIA, we need to compare two sets of data:

1. **Combined Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Depreciation and Amortization in Cash Flows from Operating Activities**: Unfortunately, the provided document pages do not contain specific data on stock-based compensation expense or depreciation and amortization within the cash flows from operating activities. Therefore, we cannot calculate the growth rate for this component.

2. **Combined Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Securities and Total Other Income (Expense), Net**:
   - **Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Securities**:
     - April 27, 2025: $139 million (Page 4)
     - April 28, 2024: $(128) million (Page 4)
     - Growth: From $(128) million to $139 million, which is a change of $267 million.
   - **Total Other Income (Expense), Net**:
     - April 27, 2025: $272 million (Page 3)
     - April 28, 2024: $370 million (Page 3)
     - Growth: From $370 million to $272 million, which is a decrease of $98 million.

   Combining these, the net change in unrealized gains (losses) increased by $267 million, while total other income (expense), net decreased by $98 million. The combined effect is an increase of $169 million.

Since we do not have the data for the first component (stock-based compensation and depreciation/amortization), we cannot calculate its growth rate or compare it to the second component.

Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine which component grew faster or by how many percentage points one exceeded the other."

"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","The document does not provide specific data on Palantir's GAAP operating income or the sequential changes in GAAP net income for Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 and Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. The information on page 37 of the Palantir Q1 investor presentation only includes a reconciliation of GAAP net income to net income excluding one-time SAR-related expenses for Q4 2024. Without the necessary data on operating income and the sequential changes for the specified quarters, it is not possible to calculate the acceleration in GAAP operating income or compare it to the acceleration in GAAP net income.

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","To calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of NVIDIA's operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, we use the formula:

\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

where:
- Ending Value is the operating lease obligation for fiscal year 2028.
- Beginning Value is the operating lease obligation for fiscal year 2026.
- \( n \) is the number of years.

From the document (Page 21), the operating lease obligations are:
- Fiscal Year 2026: $274 million
- Fiscal Year 2028: $349 million

Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{349}{274} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \]

\[ \text{CAGR} = (1.2737)^{0.5} - 1 \]

\[ \text{CAGR} = 1.131 - 1 \]

\[ \text{CAGR} = 0.131 \text{ or } 13.1\% \]

The compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028 is approximately 13.1%.

This growth in operating lease obligations is related to the company's expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases with future obligations of $7.4 billion between the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2030 (Page 21). This indicates a significant expansion in lease commitments, primarily driven by data center and office needs, which aligns with the observed growth in lease obligations."

"Which four factors did NVIDIA cite in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, what was that effective tax rate, and what estimated long-term annual effective tax rate did Palantir apply to its income tax effect for market-vesting SARs?","The specific factors cited by NVIDIA in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate are not provided in the context given. Therefore, I cannot provide the exact factors or the effective tax rate for NVIDIA.

However, the gross profit margin for the quarter ended April 27, 2025, can be calculated using the data from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income on page 3. The gross profit margin is calculated as follows:

1. Gross Profit for the quarter ended April 27, 2025: $26,668 million
2. Revenue for the quarter ended April 27, 2025: $44,062 million

Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100

"In NVIDIA's first quarter of fiscal 2026, by how many percentage points did interest income as a share of gross profit increase year-over-year, and how did that compare to the year-over-year percentage increase in research and development expenses?","To determine the year-over-year change in interest income as a share of gross profit and compare it to the year-over-year percentage increase in research and development (R&D) expenses, we need to perform the following calculations using data from the provided document:

1. **Interest Income as a Share of Gross Profit:**

   - For the quarter ending April 27, 2025:
     - Interest Income = $515 million (Page 3)
     - Gross Profit = $26,668 million (Page 3)
     - Interest Income as a Share of Gross Profit = ($515 / $26,668) * 100 = 1.93%

   - For the quarter ending April 28, 2024:
     - Interest Income = $359 million (Page 3)
     - Gross Profit = $20,406 million (Page 3)
     - Interest Income as a Share of Gross Profit = ($359 / $20,406) * 100 = 1.76%

   - Year-over-Year Change in Interest Income as a Share of Gross Profit = 1.93% - 1.76% = 0.17 percentage points

2. **Year-over-Year Percentage Increase in R&D Expenses:**

   - R&D Expenses for the quarter ending April 27, 2025 = $3,989 million (Page 3)
   - R&D Expenses for the quarter ending April 28, 2024 = $2,720 million (Page 3)
   - Percentage Increase in R&D Expenses = (($3,989 - $2,720) / $2,720) * 100 = 46.65%

**Comparison:**

- The interest income as a share of gross profit increased by 0.17 percentage points year-over-year.
- The R&D expenses increased by 46.65% year-over-year.

Thus, while the interest income as a share of gross profit saw a modest increase of 0.17 percentage points, the R&D expenses experienced a significant increase of 46.65% over the same period."

"Between the first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2026, by how many basis points did NVIDIA’s operating lease cash flow conversion ratio—calculated as operating cash flow used for operating leases divided by operating lease expense—change?","To calculate the change in NVIDIA's operating lease cash flow conversion ratio between the first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2026, we need to determine the ratio for each year and then find the difference in basis points.

1. **Fiscal Year 2026:**
   - Operating cash flow used for operating leases: $96 million (Page 21)
   - Operating lease expense: $101 million (Page 21)
   - Conversion ratio for FY 2026 = \( \frac{96}{101} \approx 0.9505 \)

2. **Fiscal Year 2025:**
   - Operating cash flow used for operating leases: $69 million (Page 21)
   - Operating lease expense: $80 million (Page 21)
   - Conversion ratio for FY 2025 = \( \frac{69}{80} = 0.8625 \)

3. **Change in Conversion Ratio:**
   - Change = 0.9505 - 0.8625 = 0.088

4. **Convert Change to Basis Points:**
   - 1 basis point = 0.01%
   - Change in basis points = 0.088 * 10000 = 880 basis points

Therefore, NVIDIA’s operating lease cash flow conversion ratio increased by 880 basis points between the first quarters of fiscal years 2025 and 2026. (Page 21)"
"According to Nvidia’s cash flow statement, when it was incorrectly claimed that net cash used in investing activities exceeded share repurchases for the period, what were the actual figures for net cash used in investing activities versus share repurchases and how did dividends paid compare to payments for employee stock plan taxes?","The provided document pages do not contain information about Nvidia's cash flow statement, net cash used in investing activities, share repurchases, dividends paid, or payments for employee stock plan taxes. Therefore, I cannot provide the actual figures or comparisons for these items. If you have access to additional pages or documents that include this information, please provide them for further analysis."
"On a quarter-over-quarter basis, by how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s net working capital change, by how many millions of dollars did its retained earnings increase, and what percentage of that retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets?","The provided document pages do not contain specific information about NVIDIA's net working capital or retained earnings, nor do they detail purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. Therefore, I cannot calculate the changes in net working capital or retained earnings, nor determine what percentage of the retained earnings increase was consumed by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. If this information is available in other parts of the document, it was not included in the pages provided."
"Under footnote 11 in J.P. Morgan’s midyear report article “IS THIS THE DOWNFALL OF THE U.S. DOLLAR?” what is the difference in percentage points between the net percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation and the year-to-date share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar as defined by the market-credibility metric in the “Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar” section?","The document does not provide information under footnote 11 or any specific details about the net percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation. However, it does provide data on the year-to-date share of trading days in 2025 with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar. According to the ""Tracking the market’s perception of the dollar"" section on page 22, only 5% of trading days in 2025 have seen simultaneous declines in these U.S. assets. Without the specific percentage of investors expecting continued dollar depreciation, a direct comparison cannot be made. Therefore, the difference in percentage points cannot be calculated based on the provided information. (Page 22)"
"In Q1 FY26, following the USG’s April 9, 2025 export licensing requirements that diminished demand for H20 products, what percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales did NVIDIA’s related excess inventory charge represent, and by how many percentage points did that percentage exceed Palantir’s Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin?","The provided document pages do not contain specific information regarding NVIDIA's Q1 FY26 excess inventory charge related to H20 products or the percentage of pre-licensing H20 sales it represents. Additionally, there is no information on Palantir's Q1 2025 adjusted operating margin. Therefore, I cannot calculate the percentage or the difference in percentage points between NVIDIA's excess inventory charge and Palantir's adjusted operating margin based on the provided context.

"What is the ratio of the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation to the three-year rolling share of trading days with simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds and currencies, and how does that ratio compare with the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years?","The document does not provide specific data on the net share of investors expecting further U.S. dollar depreciation or the volatility multiple of an unhedged ex-U.S. aggregate bond portfolio relative to a U.S. dollar domestic bond portfolio over the last 20 years. Therefore, I cannot calculate the ratio or make a comparison based on the provided context. The document does mention that in 2025, only 5% of trading days have seen simultaneous declines in U.S. stocks, bonds, and currencies (Page 22), but this is not sufficient to perform the requested analysis."
