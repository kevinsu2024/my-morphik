"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Total revenue Y/Y growth = 39% (Page 21)  
Total revenue ex‐Strategic Commercial Contracts Y/Y growth = 44% (Page 22)  
US revenue Y/Y growth = 55% (Page 18)  

Std dev of those three = 6.7%  
Calculation: sqrt([ (39−46)²+(44−46)²+(55−46)² ]/3)=√44.67≈6.7%  

Quarter-over-quarter ΔRule of 40: Q2’23→Q3’23=+8, Q3’23→Q4’23=+8, Q4’23→Q1’24=+3, Q1’24→Q2’24=+7, Q2’24→Q3’24=+4, Q3’24→Q4’24=+13, Q4’24→Q1’25=+2 (Page 32)  

Std dev of those seven = 3.5%  
Calculation: sqrt([∑(Δ−6.43)²]/7)=√12.25≈3.5%  

Both volatility metrics (6.7 pp for Y/Y revenue growth; 3.5 pp for Q/Q Rule of 40 changes) are small relative to the absolute Rule of 40 score of 83% in Q1 2025 (Page 32)."

Calculation: changes in fair value = [25,781−18,450=7,331; 26,355−23,656=2,699; 52,136−42,106=10,030] ⇒ mean=6,686.7; variance= [(7,331−6,686.7)²+(2,699−6,686.7)²+(10,030−6,686.7)²]/3 ≈9,165,0­00 ⇒ σ≈√9,165,000≈3,027 (Page 11)  

Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities: \$51 million (Page 11)
