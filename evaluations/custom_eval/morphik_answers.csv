"Based on Palantir’s reported Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 revenue figures, what are the year-over-year growth rates for total revenue, total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts, and US revenue; what is the standard deviation across those growth rates; what is the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in the Rule of 40 score from Q2 2023 through Q1 2025; and how do these volatility metrics relate to the Rule of 40 score reported for Q1 2025?","Here’s the analysis in three parts—(1) the three Y-on-Y growth rates and their dispersion, (2) the quarter-on-quarter Rule-of-40 changes and their dispersion, and (3) how that dispersion contextually relates to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score of 83 %.

---

## 1. Y-on-Y growth rates in Q1 2025

From the Q1 2025 highlights and accompanying slides:

- Total revenue:  
  Q1 2024 → Q1 2025: \$634 M → \$884 M ⇒ +39% Y/Y  
- Total revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts:  
  \$610 M → \$879 M ⇒ +44% Y/Y  
- US revenue:  
  \$405 M¹ → \$628 M ⇒ +55% Y/Y  

¹ Implied by “US revenue grew +55% Y/Y to \$628 M.”  

### Dispersion of those three growth rates

Rates = {39%, 44%, 55%}.  
Mean = (39 + 44 + 55)/3 ≃ 46.0%  
Population standard deviation  
= √[ ((39–46)² + (44–46)² + (55–46)²) / 3 ]  
= √[ (49 + 4 + 81) / 3 ]  
= √(134/3)  
≈ 6.7 percentage points  

> **Std dev ≃ 7%** across the three Y/Y growth rates.

## 2. Q-on-Q changes in Rule of 40 (Q2 2023→Q1 2025)

From the “Reconciliation of Rule of 40” table:

Quarterly Rule of 40  
Q2 2023 38%, Q3 2023 46%, Q4 2023 54%, Q1 2024 57%, Q2 2024 64%, Q3 2024 68%, Q4 2024 81%, Q1 2025 83%.

Quarter-to-quarter deltas (%)  
- Q2→Q3 2023: +8  
- Q3→Q4 2023: +8  
- Q4 2023→Q1 2024: +3  
- Q1→Q2 2024: +7  
- Q2→Q3 2024: +4  
- Q3→Q4 2024: +13  
- Q4 2024→Q1 2025: +2  

These seven observations average ≃ +6.43% per quarter.  
Population standard deviation  
= √[Σ(Δ–6.43)² / 7]  
≈ √(85.73/7)  
≈ 3.5 percentage points  

> **Std dev ≃ 3.5%** for the quarter-on-quarter Rule-of-40 changes.

## 3. Relating volatility to the Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score (83%)

- The three Y/Y revenue growth rates themselves vary by about ± 7 ppt around their 46% mean, driven especially by the standout US revenue growth of +55%.  
- By contrast, the Rule-of-40 has climbed every quarter since Q2 2023, and its quarter-to-quarter swings average +6.4 ppt with a tighter ± 3.5 ppt dispersion.  
- The Q1 2025 Rule-of-40 of **83%** is not only the highest in that eight-quarter run but sits well above the traditional 40% “hurdle.”  
- In other words, despite some variability in quarterly growth and margin contributions, the Rule-of-40 metric has improved in a relatively smooth fashion—with lower volatility (3.5 ppt) than the underlying revenue growth rates (7 ppt)—culminating in a robust 83% in Q1 2025."
"Given Palantir’s total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts and adjusted operating income for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, and its US commercial customer counts for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, by what percentage did operating expense per US commercial customer change year-over-year between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025?","First, let’s pull in the key numbers (all figures in $M except customer counts):

  
1. Global total revenue (commercial + government)  
   – Q1 2024: 299 + 335 = 634  
   – Q1 2025: 397 + 487 = 884  
2. Adjusted operating income  
   – Q1 2024: 226  
   – Q1 2025: 391  
3. US commercial customer count (TTM ended March 31)  
   – 2024: 262  
   – 2025: 432  

From these:  
• Operating expense ≃ Total revenue – Adjusted operating income  
  – Q1 2024: 634 – 226 = 408  
  – Q1 2025: 884 – 391 = 493  

• Expense per US commercial customer  
  – Q1 2024: 408 ÷ 262 ≃ 1.56 ($M per customer)  
  – Q1 2025: 493 ÷ 432 ≃ 1.14  

• Year-over-year change  
  – (1.14 – 1.56) ÷ 1.56 ≃ –0.42 ÷ 1.56 ≃ –27%

**Answer:** Operating expense per US commercial customer fell by roughly 27% year-over-year from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025."
"By how many millions of dollars did NVIDIA’s total other assets change between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many millions of dollars did assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, and what percentage of those Q1 FY2026 acquisitions was represented by the first-quarter intangible-asset amortization expense?","1. Change in total other assets  
   – Apr 27, 2025: \$6,788 million  
   – Jan 26, 2025:           \$6,425 million  
   – Increase: \$6,788 – \$6,425 = \$363 million  

2. Increase in assumed-liability acquisitions of property, equipment and intangible assets (Q1 FY 2026 vs. Q1 FY 2025)  
   – Q1 FY 2026: \$408 million  
   – Q1 FY 2025: \$147 million  
   – Increase: \$408 – \$147 = \$261 million  

3. Percentage of Q1 FY 2026 acquisitions represented by Q1 intangible-asset amortization expense  
   – Amortization expense Q1 FY 2026: \$159 million  
   – Percentage: 159 / 408 ≈ 0.3897 → ≈ 39%"
"By how many dollars did the fair value of NVIDIA’s CoreWeave investment at April 27, 2025 exceed the carrying value reclassification adjustment recorded against non-marketable equity securities in long-term other assets in Q1 FY26?","The CoreWeave investment carried an FV of \$1 billion at April 27, 2025 (Note 5(1)), and the Q1 FY26 reclassification out of non-marketable securities was \$843 million (Note 6, “Reclassification”).  

\$1,000 million – \$843 million = \$157 million  

So the fair value exceeded the reclassification adjustment by \$157 million."
"According to Palantir’s Q1 2025 investor presentation, under the false premise that the Rule of 40 score of 83% was derived by adding the adjusted free cash flow margin to the US government revenue quarter-over-quarter growth rate, what were each of those two percentages, what was the quarter-end balance in cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities, how many deals of at least $1 million closed in the quarter, and what was the US Commercial Customer Count for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025?","Here’s how the numbers would break down under that (incorrect) “back‐of‐the‐envelope” Rule-of-40 calculation:

- Adjusted free-cash-flow margin (Q1 2025): 42%¹  
- US government revenue Q/Q growth (Q1 2025 vs. Q4 2024): +9%²  
---  
- Quarter-end balance of cash, cash equivalents and US Treasury securities: \$5.4 billion³  
- Deals of at least \$1 million closed in Q1 2025: 139 deals⁴

"For NVIDIA, between the current period and the comparative prior period, which grew faster on a year-over-year basis: the combined stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization in cash flows from operating activities, or the combined net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income, and by how many percentage points did the faster growth rate exceed the slower?","**Answer:**  
The combination of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and total other income (expense), net grew faster year-over-year.  

-  **Stock-based compensation + Depreciation & amortization**  
   – 1Q FY 2026: \$1,474 + \$611 = \$2,085 million  
   – 1Q FY 2025: \$1,011 + \$410 = \$1,421 million  
   – Growth = (2,085 – 1,421) / 1,421 ≈ **46.7%**  

-  **Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities + Total other income (expense), net**  
   – 1Q FY 2026: \$139 + \$272 = \$411 million  
   – 1Q FY 2025: (–\$128) + \$370 = \$242 million  
   – Growth = (411 – 242) / 242 ≈ **69.8%**  

Difference in growth rates:  
69.8% – 46.7% ≈ **23.1 percentage points**

"Despite a claim that Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 fell year-over-year, what were the actual year-over-year dollar change and the items cited as driving this shift?","Here’s what the 10-Q actually shows for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended April 27, 2025) vs. the same period a year earlier (ended April 28, 2024):

- Net cash provided by operating activities  
  – Q1 FY 2026: \$27,414 million  
  – Q1 FY 2025: \$15,345 million  
  – Year-over-year change: **+ \$12,069 million**

Management cites the **increase** (not a decrease) as being “due to higher revenue and timing of cash collections.”  
(See “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” MD&A.)"
"Despite the implication that removing strategic commercial contracts would temper Palantir’s growth in Q1 2025, by how many percentage points did the year-over-year growth rate of total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts exceed the year-over-year growth rate of overall total revenue?","The year-over-year growth rate ex-strategic commercial contracts was 44%, versus 39% for total revenue — a gap of 5 percentage points. (44% – 39% = 5%)"
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the standard deviation of the quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated fair value across debt securities by contractual maturity (less than one year, one to five years, and total), what was the unrealized gain on corporate debt securities reported as of January 26, 2025, and what was the percentage increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value over the same period, considering the company's commentary that gross unrealized losses were driven primarily by changes in interest rates?","Below is a summary of the three requested metrics for the period January 26, 2025 to April 27, 2025, together with the Company’s commentary on the principal driver of unrealized losses:

1.  Standard deviation of Q-over-Q changes in estimated fair value  
    We first compute the change in estimated fair value by maturity bucket (in millions):

    | Maturity               | Jan 26, 2025 FV | Apr 27, 2025 FV | Change (Δ)  |
    |------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
    | Less than one year     | $18,450         | $25,781         | + \$7,331   |
    | Due in 1–5 years       | $23,656         | $26,355         | + \$2,699   |
    | Total                   | $42,106         | $52,136         | + \$10,030  |

    •  Mean of the three Δ’s = (7,331 + 2,699 + 10,030) / 3 ≈ \$6,686.7 million  
    •  Population standard deviation  
       = sqrt[ ((7,331 – 6,686.7)² + (2,699 – 6,686.7)² + (10,030 – 6,686.7)²) / 3 ]  
       ≈ \$3,028 million  

2.  Unrealized gain on corporate debt securities (as of Jan 26, 2025)  
    From the fair-value roll-forward (Note 5):  
    “Corporate debt securities… Unrealized gain $ 51 million; Unrealized loss $ (29) million.”  
    → **Unrealized gain = \$51 million.**

3.  % increase in Level 1 money market funds fair value  
    From the Level 1 fair-value table (Note 6):

    •  Jan 26, 2025 Level 1 MMF FV = \$3,760 million  
    •  Apr 27, 2025 Level 1 MMF FV = \$6,522 million  
    •  Increase = 6,522 – 3,760 = \$2,762 million  
    •  % increase = 2,762 / 3,760 ≈ 73.5%

4.  Company commentary on unrealized losses  
    “Gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.” (emphasis added)"
"After the one-time SAR-related expense hit in Q4 2024, by how many dollars did the acceleration in Palantir’s GAAP operating income—defined as the Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 sequential change minus the Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 sequential change—exceed the analogous acceleration in GAAP net income?","Here are the relevant numbers (in $M) from the GAAP Net Income and GAAP Operating Income charts:

• GAAP Net Income  
  – Q3 2024: 143.5  
  – Q4 2024:   79.0  
  – Q1 2025:  214.0  

Sequential changes:  
  • Q3→Q4 = 79.0 − 143.5 = − 64.5  
  • Q4→Q1 = 214.0 − 79.0 = + 135.0  

Acceleration (Net) = 135.0 − (− 64.5) = + 199.5  

• GAAP Operating Income  
  – Q3 2024: 113.1  
  – Q4 2024:   11.0  
  – Q1 2025:  176.0  

Sequential changes:  
  • Q3→Q4 = 11.0 − 113.1 = − 102.1  
  • Q4→Q1 = 176.0 − 11.0 = + 165.0  

Acceleration (Op) = 165.0 − (− 102.1) = + 267.1  

Difference in accelerations = 267.1 − 199.5 = **67.6 million dollars**.  

So, after the Q4 2024 SAR-related hit, the GAAP operating‐income acceleration exceeded the GAAP net‐income acceleration by about **$67.6 M**."
"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, by how many percentage points did NVIDIA’s excess inventory purchase obligations as a percentage of its total accrued and other current liabilities change, and as of April 27, 2025, what percentage of its net long-term carrying amount of debt are its outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations?","1. Change in excess inventory purchase obligations as a % of accrued & other current liabilities  
   - Jan 26, 2025:  
     – Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$2,095 M  
     – Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$11,737 M  
     – % = 2,095 / 11,737 ≈ 17.9%  
   - Apr 27, 2025:  
     – Excess inventory purchase obligations = \$4,310 M  
     – Total accrued & other current liabilities = \$19,211 M  
     – % = 4,310 / 19,211 ≈ 22.4%  
   - Change = 22.4% − 17.9% = **4.5 percentage points** increase  

2. Outstanding inventory purchase & long-term supply obligations as a % of net long-term debt  
   - Obligations (Apr 27, 2025) = \$29.8 B  
   - Net long-term carrying amount of debt = \$8.464 B

NVIDIA (Q1 FY 2026 ended April 27, 2025)  
   - Remaining performance obligations for contracts > 1 year: $1.8 billion  
     – of which $160 million was unbilled  
   - Unbilled percentage = $160 million ÷ $1,800 million ≈ 8.9%¹  

2. Palantir (Q1 2025)²

"Between the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, how many non-US commercial customers did Palantir add and what percentage of the total global commercial customer growth did this addition represent?","Between the TTM periods ending Mar 31, 2024 and Mar 31, 2025:

- Global commercial customers rose from 427 to 622, a net gain of 195.

"What was the compound annual growth rate of NVIDIA’s operating lease obligations between fiscal years 2026 and 2028, and how does this growth relate to the company’s expectation to commence new data center and office operating leases from the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2030?","Between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028, NVIDIA’s future minimum operating lease obligations grow from \$274 million to \$349 million.  Over that two-year span the implied compound annual growth rate is:

CAGR = (349 / 274)^(1/2) – 1 ≈ 12.9%

This uptick in obligations is the early-stage reflection of the company’s plan “to commence leases with future obligations of \$7.4 billion primarily of data center and office operating leases” between the second quarter of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2030 (Note 14).  In other words, the ~13% annual increase through FY 2028 is driven by—and will continue accelerating as—NVIDIA rolls out that \$7.4 billion of new data-center and office leases through FY 2030."
"For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025, what is the ratio of the standard deviation of quarter-over-quarter growth rates for US commercial customer count compared to total customer count, and what does this ratio imply about the volatility of US commercial expansion relative to management’s reported 65% year-over-year growth?","Below is a back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation of the quarter-over-quarter volatilities and their ratio.

1. Quarter-over-quarter growth rates  
   – Total customer count (TTM): 7%, 6%, 13%, 8%  
   – US commercial customer count (TTM): 9%, 7%, 15%, 9%  

2. Compute standard deviations (using a simple population formula)  
   – σ(total) ≃ sqrt([ (7–8.5)² + (6–8.5)² + (13–8.5)² + (8–8.5)² ]/4) ≃ 2.7%  
   – σ(commercial) ≃ sqrt([ (9–10)² + (7–10)² + (15–10)² + (9–10)² ]/4) ≃ 3.0%  

3. Ratio of volatilities  
   – σ(commercial) / σ(total) ≃ 3.0% / 2.7% ≃ 1.1×  

What this implies  
– US commercial customer adds are about 10% more “bumpy” quarter-to-quarter than the overall base, but both series remain quite stable (σ ≈ 3–2.7%).  
– In the context of a 65% year-over-year expansion, that modest uptick in quarterly volatility simply reflects typical seasonality in new commercial wins rather than any destabilization of the underlying growth trend."
"For NVIDIA, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, what were the dollar increase in Interest income and the dollar decline in Other income (expense), net, and what was the primary driver identified for the change in Other income (expense), net?","**Answer:**  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2026 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2025:

- **Interest income** rose by \$156 million (from \$359 million to \$515 million).  
- **Other income (expense), net** fell by \$255 million (from +\$75 million to –\$180 million).  
- The primary driver of the decline in Other income (expense), net was **unrealized losses in NVIDIA’s publicly-held equity securities** (notably Fair-value volatility in its investments in CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.).

"After deploying Palantir Eval-Driven Automation in AIP as showcased in the DevCon 2 overview, by how much did Wendy's QSCC shorten its supply chain problem resolution cycle and how much did Heineken accelerate its solution build time?","Here are the two customer outcomes highlighted on the AIPCon 6 / DevCon 2 slides:

- Wendy’s QSCC shortened its supply-chain problem-resolution cycle from “weeks and days” down to just five minutes.  
- Heineken reduced its solution build time from three years to three months (i.e. built 12× faster)."
"Management asserted that Palantir delivered an 85% adjusted gross margin, sub-$450 million of adjusted expenses, and $220 million of net income attributable to common stockholders in Q1 2025; what do the reconciliation tables actually report for those three metrics?","Here’s what the appendix reconciliation schedules actually show for Q1 2025:

1. Adjusted Gross Margin  
   - From “Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit & Adjusted Gross Margin” (Q1 2025 column):  
     • Gross Profit: $710,885 k  
     • + Stock-based comp.: $ 15,016 k  
     → Adjusted Gross Profit: $725,901 k  
     → Adjusted Gross Margin: 82%  
   (Not 85% as stated on the slides.)

2. “Sub-$450 million of adjusted expenses”  
   - The deck never gives an explicit line called “adjusted op-ex.”  Instead you back into it from the “Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Adjusted Operating Income” table:  
     • Revenue (from Revenue → Billings table): $883,855 k  
     • Adjusted Operating Income (Q1 2025): $390,710 k  
     ⇒ Implied Adjusted Operating Expenses = $883,855 k – $390,710 k = $493,145 k  
   (So, in fact, “adjusted expenses” excluding stock-based comp. and related payroll taxes work out to about $493 million, not under $450 million.)

3. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders  
   - From “Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings Per Share, Diluted to Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Diluted” (Q1 2025):  
     • Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders: $214,031 k

"Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, what was the change in Nvidia’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs expressed as a percentage of the total scheduled long-term debt principal across all maturity buckets?","Between January 26, 2025 and April 27, 2025, NVIDIA’s unamortized debt discount and issuance costs declined from $37 million to $36 million.  As a percentage of the total scheduled principal of $8.5 billion (3,750 + 1,250 + 3,500), that represents:

‐ January 26, 2025: 37 / 8,500 = 0.435%  
‐ April 27, 2025: 36 / 8,500 = 0.424%

"Which four factors did NVIDIA cite in Note 4 of its Q1 FY2026 financial statements for its effective tax rate being lower than the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, what was that effective tax rate, and what estimated long-term annual effective tax rate did Palantir apply to its income tax effect for market-vesting SARs?","**NVIDIA (Q1 FY 2026 – Note 4) – Reconciliation of the U.S. 21% Statutory Rate to the 14.3% Effective Rate**  
NVIDIA reported an income-tax expense equal to 14.3% of pre-tax income for Q1 FY 2026, well below the 21% U.S. federal statutory rate.  In Note 4 they explained that their lower rate was “primarily due to” the combined effect of four items:  

 1.  Tax benefits from the **foreign-derived intangible income deduction**  
 2.  Tax benefit on **stock-based compensation**  
 3.  **Income earned in jurisdictions** subject to rates **lower than** the 21% federal rate  
 4.  The **U.S. federal research (R&D) tax credit**  

*(Note 4 – “Our effective tax rates … were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.”)*  

**Palantir (Income Tax Effect on Market-Vesting SARs)**  
In its Appendix reconciliation of “Income Tax Effects and Adjustments Related to Market-Vesting SARs,” Palantir applies an estimated long-term annual effective tax rate of **23.0%** to translate the SAR-related pre-tax expense into an income-tax benefit.

"In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, what was NVIDIA's interest coverage ratio (interest income divided by interest expense) and what percentage of its net interest spread did net unrealized losses on publicly-held equity securities—driven by fair value volatility in investments including CoreWeave and Arm, Inc.—consume?","**Answer:**

- In Q1 FY 2026, NVIDIA posted interest income of \$515 million and interest expense of \$63 million, for an interest‐coverage ratio of:

  \[
    \frac{\$515\text{ m}}{\$63\text{ m}}
    \;\approx\;8.2\times
  \]

- Net unrealized losses on publicly‐held equity securities held at period end were \$222 million.  NVIDIA’s “net interest spread” (interest income minus interest expense) was:

  \[
    \$515\text{ m} - \$63\text{ m} = \$452\text{ m}.
  \]

  Thus, the \$222 million of net unrealized losses “consumed” about

  \[
    \frac{\$222\text{ m}}{\$452\text{ m}}
    \;\approx\;49\%
  \]

"What is the unweighted arithmetic average of Palantir’s Q1 2025 Rule of 40 score and its year-over-year growth rates in US revenue, US commercial revenue, total revenue, and total revenue excluding strategic commercial contracts?","Here are the five Q1 2025 metrics in question:

- Total revenue Y/Y growth: +39%  
- Total revenue ex-Strategic Commercial Contracts Y/Y growth: +44%  
- Rule of 40 score: 83%  

Their unweighted arithmetic average is:

(55% + 71% + 39% + 44% + 83%) ÷ 5 = 292% ÷ 5 = **58.4%**
